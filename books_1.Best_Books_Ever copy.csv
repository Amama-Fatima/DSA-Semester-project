The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and once girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","English","9780439023481","['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adventure', 'Teen', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Action']","['Katniss Everdeen', 'Peeta Mellark', 'Cato (Hunger Games)', 'Primrose Everdeen', 'Gale Hawthorne', 'Effie Trinket', 'Haymitch Abernathy', 'Cinna', 'President Coriolanus Snow', 'Rue', 'Flavius', 'Lavinia (Hunger Games)', 'Marvel', 'Glimmer', 'Clove', 'Foxface', 'Thresh', 'Greasy Sae', 'Madge Undersee', 'Caesar Flickerman', 'Claudius Templesmith', 'Octavia (Hunger Games)', 'Portia (hunger Games)']","Hardcover","First Edition","374","Scholastic Press","09/14/08","","['Locus Award Nominee for Best Young Adult Book (2009)', 'Georgia Peach Book Award (2009)', 'Buxtehuder Bulle (2009)', 'Golden Duck Award for Young Adult (Hal Clement Award) (2009)', ""Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire Nominee for Roman jeunesse étranger (2010)"", 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Older Readers (2012)', ""West Australian Young Readers' Book Award (WAYRBA) for Older Readers (2010)"", ""Red House Children's Book Award for Older Readers & Overall (2010)"", 'South Carolina Book Award for Junior and Young Adult Book (2011)', 'Charlotte Award (2010)', 'Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award (2010)', 'Teen Buckeye Book Award (2009)', ""Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award for Young Adults (2010)"", 'Rhode Island Teen Book Award (2010)', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award (2010)"", 'Evergreen Teen Book Award (2011)', 'Soaring Eagle Book Award (2009)', 'Milwaukee County Teen Book Award Nominee (2010)', 'Sakura Medal for Middle School Book (2010)', 'Michigan Library Association Thumbs Up!

With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.","English","9780451526342","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Politics', 'School', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Read For School']","['Snowball', 'Napoleon', 'Clover', 'Boxer', 'Old Major', 'Muriel', 'Jones', 'Squealer', 'Moses the Raven', 'Benjamin']","Mass Market Paperback","","141","Signet Classics","04/28/96","08/17/45","['Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (2011)', 'Retro Hugo Award for Best Novella (1996)']","2740713","['986764', '958699', '545475', '165093', '84682']","91","['England', 'United Kingdom']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1325861570l/170448.jpg","1276599","13264",4.42

In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Misérables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope—an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.","English","9999999999999","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'France', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'French Literature', 'Romance', 'Classic Literature']","['Jean Valjean', 'Javert', 'Cosette', 'Fantine', 'Bishop Myriel', 'M. & Mme.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com","English","9780812550702","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure']","['Dink', 'Bernard', 'Valentine Wiggin', 'Peter Wiggin', 'Mazer Rackham', 'Alai', 'Hyrum Graff', 'Andrew Wiggin', 'Petra Arkanian', '""Bean""', 'Major Anderson', 'Bonzo', 'Major Imbu']","Audiobook","Unabridged","324","Macmillan Audio","09/30/04","10/28/85","['Hugo Award for Best Novel (1986)', 'Nebula Award for Best Novel (1985)', 'Nébula (1985)', 'Margaret A.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

Highly original and imaginative, this debut novel raises questions about life, love, and the effects of time on relationships.Audrey Niffenegger’s innovative debut, The Time Traveler’s Wife, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing. The Time Traveler’s Wife depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare’s marriage and their passionate love for each other as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals—steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.","English","9781939126016","['Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'Magical Realism']","['Henry DeTamble', 'Clare Abshire', 'Gomez', 'Charisse', 'Richard DeTamble', 'Alicia Abshire', 'Mark Abshire', 'Philip Abshire', 'Lucille Abshire', 'Mrs. Kim', 'Alba DeTamble', 'Ingrid Carmichael', 'Celia Attley', 'Dr. David Kendrick']","ebook","Special Edition","500","Zola Books","09/23/13","07/05/03","['Arthur C.

"5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye","The Catcher in the Rye","","J.D. Salinger","3.81","The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","English","9780316769174","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Literature', 'School', 'Novels', 'Coming Of Age', 'American', 'High School', 'Read For School']","['Holden Caulfield', 'Robert Ackley', 'Stradlater', 'Phoebe Caulfield', 'Allie Caulfield', 'D.B Caulfield', 'Sally Hayes', 'Holden Caufield', 'Robert Ackley', 'Stradlater', 'Phoebe Caulfield', 'Allie Caulfield', 'D.B Caulfield', 'Sally Hayes']","Paperback","First Back Bay Paperback Edition (US/CAN)","277","Back Bay Books","01/30/01","07/16/51","['Teen Read Award Nominee for Best All-Time-Fave (2010)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1952)']","2736523","['937208', '846027', '579292', '234980', '139016']","86","['New York City, New York (United States)', 'Agerstown, Pennsylvania (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398034300l/5107.jpg","603268","6533",2.6

"2998.The_Secret_Garden","The Secret Garden","","Frances Hodgson Burnett","4.13","""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911.  The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity.  The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy.  The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance.

It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives—the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness—are inextricable from the history playing out around them.Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heart-wrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love—a stunning accomplishment.--front flap","English","9781594489501","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'War', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Drama', 'Literature']","['Laila', 'Mariam', 'Rasheed', 'Tariq']","Hardcover","U.S. Edition","372","Riverhead Books","06/01/07","05/22/07","['British Book Award for Best Read of the Year (2008)', 'Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction (2008)', 'California Book Award for Fiction (Silver) (2007)', 'Exclusive Books Boeke Prize Nominee (2007)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2011)']","1151288","['624406', '376677', '119523', '21990', '8692']","97","['Afghanistan', 'Kabul (Afghanistan)', 'Herat (Afghanistan)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1345958969l/128029.jpg","580722","6164",1.16

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.source: georgerrmartin.com","English","9780553588484","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Dragons', 'Audiobook', 'Epic']","['Brandon Stark', 'Catelyn Stark', 'Tyrion Lannister', 'Daenerys Targaryen', 'Eddard Stark', 'Theon Greyjoy', 'Robb Stark', 'Arya Stark', 'Jaime Lannister', 'Joffrey Baratheon', 'Robert Baratheon', 'Tywin Lannister', 'Lysa Arryn', 'Petyr Baelish', 'Sansa Stark', 'Viserys Targaryen', 'Varys', 'Hodor', 'Beric Dondarrion', 'Thoros of Myr', 'Sandor Clegane', 'Samwell Tarly', 'Pyp', 'Tommen Baratheon', 'Stannis Baratheon', 'Grenn', 'Mace Tyrell', 'Septa Mordane', 'Jon Snow', 'Cersei Lannister', 'Jorah Mormont']","Mass Market Paperback","","835","Bantam","08/28/05","08/06/96","['Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)', 'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (1997)', 'World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)', 'Premio Ignotus for Novela extranjera (2003)']","2003043","['1231600', '540493', '156705', '41880', '32365']","96","['The Lands of Ice and Fire']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234l/13496.jpg","562241","6007",4.01

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for ""social"") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

"1381.The_Odyssey","The Odyssey","","Homer, Robert Fagles (Translator), Bernard Knox (Introduction)","3.77","Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turnsdriven time and again off course, once he had plunderedthe hallowed heights of Troy.So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the Odyssey, which Jasper Griffin in The New York Times Review of Books hails as ""a distinguished achievement.""If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, then the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.--Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.","English","9780143039952","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Read For School', 'Historical Fiction']","['Odysseus', 'Penelope (wife of Odysseus)', 'Helen of Troy', 'Achilles (Greek hero)', 'Telemachus', 'Minerva', 'Polyphemus', 'Agamemnon']","Paperback","","541","Penguin Classics","11/30/06","10/28/00","[]","861486","['265910', '274273', '213021', '74221', '34061']","87","['Ithaca (Greece)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390173285l/1381.jpg","494442","5437",3.65

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","English","9999999999999","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Medieval', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Adult']","['Thomas Becket', 'Henry II of England', 'Tom Builder', 'Prior Philip', 'Aliena', 'Jack Jackson', 'Stephen of England', 'Empress Matilda', 'William Hamleigh', 'Ellen', 'Richard of Kingsbridge', 'Alfred Builder', 'Waleran Bigod', 'Lord Percy Hamleigh', 'Lady Regan Hamleigh', 'Remigius']","Paperback","","976","NAL Trade","02/04/02","10/28/89","[]","648793","['354788', '189091', '71541', '21183', '12190']","95","['England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100l/5043.jpg","392260","4221",""

While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing.

Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (""The"") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable.

Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.","English","9780307265432","['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Classics', 'Horror', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Apocalyptic', 'Contemporary']","['The man', 'The boy']","Hardcover","First U.S. Edition","241","Alfred A.

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.","English","9780007205233","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'Ireland', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Irish Literature', 'Historical']","['Frank McCourt']","Paperback","","452","Harper Perennial","10/03/05","09/05/96","['Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography (1997)', 'American Booksellers Book Of The Year  Award for Adult Trade (1997)', 'Audie Award for Nonfiction, Abridged (1997)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography (1996)', 'Exclusive Books Boeke Prize (1997)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography/Autobiography (1996)']","539576","['224972', '193782', '88173', '22464', '10185']","94","['Limerick (Ireland)', 'New York State (United States)', 'Ireland']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348317139l/252577.jpg","290485","3242",2.76

But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer.

"43763.Interview_with_the_Vampire","Interview with the Vampire","The Vampire Chronicles #1","Anne Rice","4.00","This is the story of Louis, as told in his own words, of his journey through mortal and immortal life. Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even ""settle down"" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.source: annerice.com","English","9780345476876","['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Vampires', 'Paranormal', 'Supernatural', 'Classics', 'Gothic', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction']","['Lestat de Lioncourt', 'Claudia', 'Daniel Molloy', 'Louis de Pointe du Lac']","Paperback","","342","Ballantine Books","08/31/04","04/12/76","['British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1977)']","484530","['180566', '167133', '100554', '26802', '9475']","93","['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)', 'Paris (France)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380631642l/43763.jpg","208415","2388",2.66

"24583.The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer","The Adventures of Tom Sawyer","Adventures of Tom and Huck #1","Mark Twain, Guy Cardwell (Annotations), John Seelye (Introduction)","3.91","The Adventures of Tom Sawyer revolves around the youthful adventures of the novel's schoolboy protagonist, Thomas Sawyer, whose reputation precedes him for causing mischief and strife. Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives ""lickings"" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a ""tattle-tale.""  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get ""engaged"" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been ""engaged"" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:""TOM!"" No answer. ""TOM!"" No answer. ""What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!"" No answer. The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for ""style,"" not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: ""Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—"" She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat. ""I never did see the beat of that boy!""","English","9780143039563","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Young Adult', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Childrens', 'School', 'Novels', 'American']","['Huckleberry Finn', 'Tom Sawyer']","Paperback","Annotated","244","Penguin Classics","02/28/06","10/28/76","['Lewis Carroll Shelf Award (1967)']","758171","['246612', '275196', '176772', '43185', '16406']","92","['Hannibal, Missouri (United States)', 'Missouri (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404811979l/24583.jpg","147006","1806",3.36

There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. In Cold Blood is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.","English","9780679745587","['Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'History', 'Literature', 'Thriller', 'American', 'Biography']","['Perry Edward Smith', 'Richard Hickock', 'Herb Clutter', 'Bonnie Clutter', 'Nancy Clutter', 'Kenyon Clutter', 'Alvin Dewey']","Paperback","First Vintage International edition","343","Vintage","10/28/94","10/28/65","['Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime (1966)']","529229","['213888', '189463', '88958', '22917', '14003']","93","['Holcomb, Kansas (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1424931136l/168642.jpg","125917","1494",6.58

They offer a unique glimpse into life on the American frontier, and tell the heartwarming, unforgettable story of a loving family.Little House in the Big WoodsMeet the Ingalls family—Laura, Ma, Pa, Mary, and baby Carrie, who all live in a cozy log cabin in the big woods of Wisconsin in the 1870s. Though many of their neighbors are wolves and panthers and bears, the woods feel like home, thanks to Ma’s homemade cheese and butter and the joyful sounds of Pa’s fiddle.Farmer BoyAs Laura Ingalls is growing up in a little house in Kansas, Almanzo Wilder lives on a big farm in New York. He and his brothers and sisters work hard from dawn to supper to help keep their family farm running. Almanzo wishes for just one thing—his very own horse—but he must prove that he is ready for such a big responsibility.Little House on the PrairieWhen Pa decides to sell the log house in the woods, the family packs up and moves from Wisconsin to Kansas, where Pa builds them their little house on the prairie! Living on the farm is different from living in the woods, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie.On the Banks of Plum CreekThe Ingalls family lives in a sod house beside Plum Creek in Minnesota until Pa builds them a new house made of sawed lumber. The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. Pa starts work on the first building of the brand new town, located on the shores of Silver Lake. The Long WinterThe first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. With snow piled as high as the rooftops, it’s impossible for trains to deliver supplies, and the townspeople, including Laura and her family, are starving. Young Almanzo Wilder, who has settled in the town, risks his life to save the town.Little Town on the PrairieDe Smet is rejuvenated with the beginning of spring. But in addition to the parties, socials, and “literaries,” work must continue. Laura spends many hours sewing shirts to help Ma and Pa get enough money to send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden YearsLaura must continue to earn money to keep Mary in her college for the blind, so she gets a job as a teacher. It’s not easy, and for the first time she’s living away from home. But it gets a little better every Friday, when Almanzo picks Laura up to take her back home for the weekend. Though Laura is still young, she and Almanzo are officially courting, and she knows that this is a time for new beginnings.The First Four YearsLaura Ingalls and Almanzo Wilder have just been married! They move to a small prairie homestead to start their lives together. But each year brings new challenges—storms, sickness, fire, and unpaid debts. These first four years call for courage, strength, and a great deal of determination. And through it all, Laura and Almanzo still have their love, which only grows when baby Rose arrives.","English","9780060529963","['Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Historical', 'Middle Grade', 'Juvenile', 'Literature', 'Kids']","[]","Boxed Set","Box Set","2700","Avon Books","10/07/03","10/28/71","[]","141514","['78697', '40270', '16803', '3312', '2432']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577932823l/114345._SX318_.jpg","115088","1361",""

It begins in the early part of this century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister; and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph's course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican; and Meggie's except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.Wonderful characters people this book; strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory; dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women; Meggie; Ralph; and Meggie's children, Justine and Dane. And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.(First Edition Jacket)","English","9999999999999","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Romance', 'Classics', 'Australia', 'Historical', 'Historical Romance', 'Novels', 'Drama', 'Adult']","['Ralph de Bricassart', 'Meghann ""Meggie"" Cleary', ""Luke O'Neill"", 'Fiona ""Fee"" Cleary', 'Padraic ""Paddy"" Cleary', 'Francis ""Frank"" Cleary', ""Dane O'Neill"", ""Justine O'Neill"", 'Mary Elizabeth Cleary Carson', 'Rainer ""Rain"" Moerling Hartheim', 'Luddie Mueller', 'Anne Mueller', 'Archbishop (later Cardinal) Vittorio di Contini-Verchese', 'Bob Cleary', 'Jack Cleary', 'Hughie Cleary', 'Stuart ""Stu"" Cleary', 'James and Patrick ""Jims and Patsy"" Cleary', 'Harold ""Hal"" Cleary']","Mass Market Paperback","25th Anniversary Edition","692","Avon Books","10/28/02","04/28/77","[]","314471","['152746', '99639', '47788', '10572', '3726']","95","['Australia', 'New Zealand', 'Vatican City (Italy)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548530867l/3412._SY475_.jpg","104397","1264",""

Every April, when the wind blows in from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood. No other author today touches our emotions more deeply than Nicholas Sparks.Illuminating both the strength and the gossamer fragility of our deepest emotions, his two New York Times bestsellers, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, have established him as the leading author of today's most cherished love stories. Now, in A Walk to Remember, he tells a truly unforgettable story, one that glimmers with all of his magic, holding us spellbound-and reminding us that in life each of us may find one great love, the kind that changes everything...","English","9999999999999","['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Drama', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Love']","['Landon Carter', 'Jamie Sullivan']","Kindle Edition","","215","Grand Central Publishing","05/24/00","10/01/99","['Iowa High School Book Award (2004)']","673094","['322650', '200662', '109366', '27704', '12712']","94","['Beaufort, North Carolina (United States)', 'North Carolina (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498755310l/35545737._SY475_.jpg","104191","1217",""

No one quite knows the reason.""Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His ""wonderful, awful"" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.

"19501.Eat_Pray_Love","Eat, Pray, Love","","Elizabeth Gilbert (Goodreads Author)","3.57","A celebrated writer's irresistible, candid, and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure, spiritual devotion, and what she really wanted out of life. Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.","English","9780143038412","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'Chick Lit', 'Romance', 'Spirituality', 'Contemporary', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography']","['Liz Gilbert', 'Felipe', 'Richard from Texas', 'Wayan']","Paperback","","368","Riverhead Books","02/01/07","02/16/06","['Puddly Award for Nonfiction (2008)']","1474731","['411702', '410861', '368837', '170758', '112573']","81","['Italy', 'India', 'Bali (Indonesia)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503066414l/19501.jpg","97131","1123",2.86

Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d’Artagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress “Milady”; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen—and, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto “all for one, one for all” has come to epitomize devoted friendship. With a plot that delivers stolen diamonds, masked balls, purloined letters, and, of course, great bouts of swordplay, The Three Musketeers is eternally entertaining.","English","9999999999999","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adventure', 'France', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'French Literature', 'Classic Literature', 'Novels']","[""D'Artagnan"", 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'Cardinal Richelieu', 'King Louis XIII', 'Anne of Austria', 'Milady de Winter', 'George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham', 'Monsieur de Treville']","Paperback","","625","Modern Library","02/13/01","03/28/44","[]","273714","['103957', '101696', '54638', '10239', '3184']","95","['Paris (France)', 'La Rochelle (France)', 'France']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320436982l/7190.jpg","95549","1198",""

In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet weekly to play mahjong and tell stories of what they left behind in China. United in loss and new hope for their daughters' futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers' advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives – until their own inner crises reveal how much they've unknowingly inherited of their mothers' pasts. With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.","English","9780143038092","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'China', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Literature', 'Asia', 'Novels']","['Suyuan Woo', 'June Woo', 'Lindo Jong', 'Waverly Jong', 'An-Mei Hsu', 'Rose Hsu Jordan', 'Ying-Ying St. Clair', 'Lena St. Clair']","Paperback","","288","Penguin Group","09/21/06","10/28/89","['California Book Award for Fiction (Gold) (1989)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (1989)', 'Northern California Book Awards for Fiction (1989)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (1989)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1989)']","597870","['197959', '224003', '128294', '32176', '15438']","92","['San Francisco, California (United States)', 'China']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586662847l/7763._SY475_.jpg","82631","1037",4.74

An ardent devourer of sentimental novels, she longs for passion and seeks escape in fantasies of high romance, in voracious spending and, eventually, in adultery. But even her affairs bring her disappointment, and when real life continues to fail to live up to her romantic expectations, the consequences are devastating. Flaubert's erotically charged and psychologically acute portrayal of Emma Bovary caused a moral outcry on its publication in 1857. It was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for his heroine; but Flaubert insisted: 'Madame Bovary, c'est moi.'This modern translation by Flaubert's biographer, Geoffrey Wall, retains all the delicacy and precision of the French original.

After running away from the workhouse and pompous beadle Mr Bumble, Oliver finds himself lured into a den of thieves peopled by vivid and memorable characters - the Artful Dodger, vicious burglar Bill Sikes, his dog Bull's Eye, and prostitute Nancy, all watched over by cunning master-thief Fagin. Combining elements of Gothic Romance, the Newgate Novel and popular melodrama, Dickens created an entirely new kind of fiction, scathing in its indictment of a cruel society, and pervaded by an unforgettable sense of threat and mystery.This Penguin Classics edition of Oliver Twist is the first critical edition to faithfully reproduce the text as its earliest readers would have encountered it from its serialisation in Bentley's Miscellany, and includes an introduction by Philip Horne, a glossary of Victorian thieves' slang, a chronology of Dickens's life, a map of contemporary London and all of George Cruikshank's original illustrations.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Hartmetz (Goodreads Author) (Editor)","3.83","""For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, Treasure Island has never been surpassed. From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like Treasure Island that can keep boys and old men happy.'","English","9780753453803","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Young Adult', 'Historical Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Literature', 'Pirates', 'Fantasy', 'Novels']","['Jim Hawkins', 'Billy Bones', 'Doctor Livesey', 'Captain Smollet', 'Squire John Trelawney', 'Ben Gunn', 'Long John Silver']","Hardcover","","311","Kingfisher","09/15/01","10/28/79","['Odyssey Award Nominee (2008)', 'Prêmio Jabuti Nominee for Adaptação (2017)', 'Audie Award for Classic (2008)']","402027","['113094', '148264', '108685', '24407', '7577']","92","['Treasure Island', 'Bristol, England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485248909l/295.jpg","77086","1041",5.6

The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.","English","9780140424386","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'School', 'Medieval', 'Short Stories', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classic Literature', 'Read For School']","[]","Paperback","This translation by Nevill Coghill first published in 1951","521","Penguin Books/Penguin Classics","01/30/03","10/28/00","[]","188606","['37516', '58287', '62106', '22655', '8042']","84","['England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1261208589l/2696.jpg","73812","984",3.9

Ernest Hemingway famously said that he rewrote his ending to A Farewell to Arms thirty-nine times to get the words right.","English","9780099910107","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Romance', 'Classic Literature', 'School']","['Frederic Henry', 'Catherine Barkley', 'Rinaldi']","Paperback","","293","Arrow Books","10/28/04","10/28/29","[]","263216","['75343', '97143', '63124', '19985', '7621']","90","['Italy', 'Milan (Italy)', 'Switzerland']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1313714836l/10799.jpg","72855","935",0.91
"58696.David_Copperfield","David Copperfield","","Charles Dickens, Jeremy Tambling (Introduction)","4.00","David Copperfield is the story of a young man's adventures on his journey from an unhappy and impoverished childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist. Among the gloriously vivid cast of characters he encounters are his tyrannical stepfather, Mr Murdstone; his brilliant, but ultimately unworthy school-friend James Steerforth; his formidable aunt, Betsey Trotwood; the eternally humble, yet treacherous Uriah Heep; frivolous, enchanting Dora Spenlow; and the magnificently impecunious Wilkins Micawber, one of literature's great comic creations. In David Copperfield - the novel he described as his 'favourite child' - Dickens drew revealingly on his own experiences to create one of the most exuberant and enduringly popular works, filled with tragedy and comedy in equal measure. This edition uses the text of the first volume publication of 1850, and includes updated suggestions for further reading, original illustrations by 'Phiz', a revised chronology and expanded notes. In his new introduction, Jeremy Tambling discusses the novel's autobiographical elements, and its central themes of memory and identity.","English","9999999999999","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', '19th Century', 'British Literature', 'Classic Literature', 'Victorian', 'Audiobook']","['Richard Babley', 'Mr. Barkis', 'Mr. Chillip', 'David Copperfield', 'Mr. Creakle', 'The Rev.

Frank Baum's classic tale we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious Witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability, and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to become the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly, and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.An astonishingly rich re-creation of the land of Oz, this book retells the story of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, who wasn't so wicked after all. Taking readers past the yellow brick road and into a phantasmagoric world rich with imagination and allegory, Gregory Maguire just might change the reputation of one of the most sinister characters in literature.","English","9780060987107","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Retellings', 'Adult Fiction', 'Magic', 'Witches', 'Fairy Tales', 'Classics']","['Elphaba Thropp', 'Liir', 'Glinda Upland', 'Galinda Upland', 'Madam Morrible', 'Nessarose Thropp', 'Fiyero Tigelaar', 'The Wizard of Oz']","Paperback","","406","William Morrow Paperbacks","10/28/00","09/29/95","['Tähtifantasia Award Nominee (2009)']","573497","['147981', '168422', '143086', '70499', '43509']","80","['Oz']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437733293l/37442._SY475_.jpg","69973","846",2.76

A beautiful woman torn between two ways of life. All brought together in an extraordinary saga aflame with passion, conflict, ambition, and the struggle for power.Here is the world-famous novel of Japan that is the earliest book in James Clavell’s masterly Asian saga. Set in the year 1600, it tells the story of a bold English pilot whose ship was blown ashore in Japan, where he encountered two people who were to change his life: a warlord with his own quest for power, and a beautiful interpreter torn between two ways of life and two ways of love. The principal figures are John Blackthorne, whose dream it is to be the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe, to wrest control of the trade between Japan and China from Portuguese, and to return home a man of wealth and position; Toranaga, the most powerful feudal lord in Japan, who strives and schemes to seize ultimate power by becoming Shogun—the Supreme Military Dictator—and to unite the warring samurai fiefdoms under his own masterly and farsighted leadership; and the Lady Mariko, a Catholic convert whose conflicting loyalties to the Church and her country are compounded when she falls in love with Blackthorne, the barbarian intruder. In dramatizing how a Westerner, the representative man of his time, comes to be altered by his exposure to an alien culture, Mr. Clavell provides a spellbinding depiction of a nation seething with violence and intrigue as it moves from the medieval world to the modern.","English","9780440178002","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Japan', 'Historical', 'Classics', 'Adventure', 'Asia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Japanese Literature']","['John Blackthorne', 'Toranaga', 'Mariko', 'Jabu', 'Buntaró', 'Hiromacu', 'Martin Alvito', 'Jaemon', 'Išido', 'Ochiba']","Paperback","","1152","Dell","02/19/09","06/01/75","[]","146776","['82685', '43852', '16060', '3025', '1154']","97","['Ajiro (Japan)', 'Tokyo (Japan)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397228842l/402093.jpg","68575","839",7.04

But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors.

"7332.The_Silmarillion","The Silmarillion","Middle-earth Universe","J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (Editor), Ted Nasmith (Illustrator)","3.93","A number-one New York Times bestseller when it was originally published, THE SILMARILLION is the core of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before THE HOBBIT.Tolkien considered THE SILMARILLION his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing. The story of the creation of the world and of the the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. THE SILMARILLION is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkien describing his intentions for the book, which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.","English","9780618391110","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Adventure']","['Gandalf', 'Saruman', 'Elrond Half-elven', 'Galadriel', 'Finwë', 'Fingolfin', 'Celebrian', 'Bregor', 'Beren', 'Túrin Turambar', 'Húrin Thalion', 'Niënor', 'Glaurung', 'Fëanor', 'Tuor', 'Lúthien', 'Morgoth']","Hardcover","","386","Houghton Mifflin Company","11/15/04","09/15/77","['Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (1978)', 'Ditmar Award for Best International Long Fiction (1978)', 'Gandalf Award (1978)']","219296","['84035', '65174', '46508', '17005', '6574']","89","['Middle-earth']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565193934l/7332.jpg","64365","776",17.07

But Mariamne has a further gift: an illness has left her with visions; she has the power of prophecy. It is her prophesying that drives the two girls to flee to Egypt, where they study philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy in the Great Library of Alexandria.After seven years they return to a Judaea where many now believe John the Baptizer is the messiah. Salome too begins to believe, but Mariamne, now called Magdalene, is drawn to his cousin, Yeshu'a, a man touched by the divine in the same way she was during her days of illness. Together they speak of sharing their direct experience of God; but Yeshu'a unexpectedly gains a reputation as a healer, and as the ill and the troubled flock to him, he and Magdalene are forced to make a terrible decision.This radical retelling of the greatest story ever told brings Mary Magdalene to life—not as a prostitute or demon-possessed—but as an educated woman who was truly the ""apostle to the apostles.""From the Hardcover edition.","English","9780307346667","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Religion', 'Historical', 'Spirituality', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Biblical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Biblical']","['Salome', 'John the Baptizer', 'Yeshu’a', 'Mary Magdalene']","Hardcover","","448","Crown","03/27/07","10/28/05","[]","4260","['2189', '960', '571', '297', '243']","87","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1175446011l/514811._SY475_.jpg","63985","657",5.6

"310612.A_Confederacy_of_Dunces","A Confederacy of Dunces","","John Kennedy Toole, Walker Percy (Foreword)","3.89","Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found here""A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.""Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, A Confederacy of Dunces. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. (""Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss."") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job.Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through A Confederacy of Dunces are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life.","English","9780802130204","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Literature', 'Comedy', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary']","['Ignatius Jacques Reilly', 'Myrna Minkoff', 'Irene Reilly', 'Santa Battaglia', 'Angelo Mancuso', 'Lana Lee', 'Burma Jones']","Paperback","","394","Grove Press","01/28/94","05/01/80","['Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (1981)', 'PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction Nominee (1981)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (1980)']","231036","['91401', '67618', '39752', '18928', '13337']","86","['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562554946l/310612._SY475_.jpg","63046","727",5.91

A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions.

"17250.The_Crucible","The Crucible","","Arthur Miller, Christopher Bigs(Introduction)","3.59","""I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history,"" Arthur Miller wrote of his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""witch-hunts"" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, ""Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.""WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.(back cover)","English","9780142437339","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Drama', 'School', 'Read For School', 'Historical', 'High School', 'Literature']","['Rev.

The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries—and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.Girl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant—and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.","English","9780452287020","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Classics', 'Art', 'Romance', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Literature']","['Johannes Vermeer', 'Griet', 'Pieter van Ruijven', 'Catharina Bolnes', 'Maria Thins', 'Tanneke', 'Pieter (Girl with a pearl earring)', 'Antonie van Leeuwenhoek']","Paperback","Deluxe Edition","233","Plume/Penguin","10/28/05","10/28/99","['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2000)', 'ALA Alex Award (2001)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2006)', 'Premi Llibreter de narrativa Nominee (2001)']","626689","['194523', '235382', '146900', '33893', '15991']","92","['Delft (Netherlands)', 'Netherlands']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327197580l/2865.jpg","57743","752",2.86

"480204.The_Phantom_of_the_Opera","The Phantom of the Opera","","Gaston Leroux, Alexander Teixeira de Mattos (Translator)","3.96","First published in French as a serial in 1909, The Phantom of the Opera is a riveting story that revolves around the young, Swedish Christine Daaé. Her father, a famous musician, dies, and she is raised in the Paris Opera House with his dying promise of a protective angel of music to guide her. After a time at the opera house, she begins hearing a voice, who eventually teaches her how to sing beautifully. All goes well until Christine's childhood friend Raoul comes to visit his parents, who are patrons of the opera, and he sees Christine when she begins successfully singing on the stage. The voice, who is the deformed, murderous 'ghost' of the opera house named Erik, however, grows violent in his terrible jealousy, until Christine suddenly disappears. The phantom is in love, but it can only spell disaster.Leroux's work, with characters ranging from the spoiled prima donna Carlotta to the mysterious Persian from Erik's past, has been immortalized by memorable adaptations. Despite this, it remains a remarkable piece of Gothic horror literature in and of itself, deeper and darker than any version that follows.","English","9780060809249","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Romance', 'Gothic', 'Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'France', 'Literature', 'Fantasy']","['Erik', 'Christine Daaé', 'Madame Giry', 'Raoul de Chagny', 'La Carlotta', '""The Persian""', 'Count Phillippe de Chagny']","Paperback","","360","Harper Perennial","12/30/87","09/23/09","[]","198779","['71880', '66493', '45110', '11658', '3638']","92","['Paris (France)', 'Bretagne (France)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327867727l/480204.jpg","54690","705",2.86
"12691.Marley_and_Me","Marley and Me: Life and Love With the World's Worst Dog","","John Grogan","4.13","John and Jenny were just beginning their life together. They were young and in love, with a perfect little house and not a care in the world. Then they brought home Marley, a wiggly yellow furball of a puppy. Life would never be the same.Marley quickly grew into a barreling, ninety-seven-pound streamroller of a Labrador retriever, a dog like no other. He crashed through screen doors, gouged through drywall, flung drool on guests, stole women's undergarments, and ate nearly everything he could get his mouth around, including couches and fine jewelry. Obedience school did no good—Marley was expelled. Neither did the tranquilizers the veterinarian prescribed for him with the admonishment, ""Don't hesitate to use these.""And yet Marley's heart was pure. Just as he joyfully refused any limits on his behavior, his love and loyalty were boundless, too. Marley shared the couple's joy at their first pregnancy, and their heartbreak over the miscarriage. He was there when babies finally arrived and when the screams of a seventeen-year-old stabbing victim pierced the night. Marley shut down a public beach and managed to land a role in a feature-length movie, always winning hearts as he made a mess of things. Through it all, he remained steadfast, a model of devotion, even when his family was at its wit's end. Unconditional love, they would learn, comes in many forms.","English","9780739461198","['Nonfiction', 'Animals', 'Memoir', 'Dogs', 'Biography', 'Humor', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Autobiography']","['Jenny', 'Patrick Grogan', 'Marley', 'Conor Grogan', 'Colleen Grogan', 'Família Grogan', 'John Grogan']","Hardcover","","291","William Morrow; 1ST edition","10/18/05","","['Puddly Award for Nonfiction (2007)']","440572","['189301', '151102', '76944', '16780', '6445']","95","['United States of America']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1308858322l/12691.jpg","54671","686",5.29
"24337.Ella_Enchanted","Ella Enchanted","Ella Enchanted #1","Gail Carson Levine (Goodreads Author)","3.98","At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the ""gift"" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.","English","9780590920681","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fairy Tales', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade', 'Retellings', 'Magic', 'Adventure']","['Ella Varner', 'Lucinda', 'Mandy', 'Prince Charmont', 'Areida', 'Hattie', 'Olive Abroholos Elephanta']","Paperback","First Scholastic Edition","232","Scholastic Books","09/01/98","04/25/97","['Newbery Medal Nominee (1998)', ""Mythopoeic Fantasy Award Nominee for Children's Literature (1999)"", 'Grand Canyon Reader Award for Teen Book (1999)', 'Maryland Black-Eyed Susan Book Award for Grade 6-9 (2000)', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award (1999)"", 'Iowa Teen Award (2000)', 'California Young Readers Medal for Middle School/Junior High (2000)', ""Rebecca Caudill Young Readers' Book Award (2000)""]","386881","['146547', '123656', '86772', '21924', '7982']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410727190l/24337.jpg","54609","680",1.91

Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria.Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.Three books in one volume: The Thieving Magpie, Bird as Prophet, The Birdcatcher.

There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing.

""I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers."" January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb...As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.","English","9781984801814","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'World War II', 'Book Club', 'War', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Books About Books']","['Sophie Kintock', 'Juliet Ashton', 'Dawsey Adams', 'Susan Scott', 'Sidney Stark', 'Elizabeth McKenna', 'Isola Pribby', 'Markham V.

Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from ""the good fight,"" For Whom the Bell Tolls. The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan's love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo's last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving and wise.

"546018.Roots","Roots: The Saga of an American Family","","Alex Haley","4.43","When he was a boy in Henning, Tennessee, Alex Haley's grandmother used to tell him stories about their family—stories that went back to her grandparents, and their grandparents, down through the generations all the way to a man she called ""the African."" She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the ""Kamby Bolongo"" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of ""the African""—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the Lord Ligonier to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him—slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects—and one author.But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. But Roots speaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.","English","9780440174646","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'African American', 'Africa', 'Race', 'Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Novels']","['George Lincoln Rockwell', 'Alex Haley', 'Kunta Kinte']","Mass Market Paperback","","729","Dell Publishing Company","01/01/77","08/17/76","['ASJA Outstanding Book Award (1978)', 'Audie Award for Nonfiction (2008)', 'Premio Bancarella (1978)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (1976)', 'Lillian Smith Book Award (1977)']","146094","['85617', '42483', '14464', '2384', '1146']","98","['United States of America', 'Gambia']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329398936l/546018.jpg","50100","658",3.1

In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back cover","English","9999999999999","['Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'Holocaust', 'Autobiography', 'War', 'World War II']","['Anne Frank', 'Otto Frank', 'Petronella van Daan', 'Hermann van Daan', 'Margot Frank', 'Peter van Daan', 'Edith Frank', 'Miep Gies', 'Albert Dussel', 'Anne Frank']","Mass Market Paperback","US / CAN Edition","283","Bantam","07/28/93","06/25/47","['Luisterboek Award Nominee (2008)']","2741134","['1266466', '859538', '438340', '112847', '63943']","94","['Amsterdam (Netherlands)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560816565l/48855.jpg","48005","620",""

"12996.Othello","Othello","","William Shakespeare","3.90","In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.","English","9780743477550","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Drama', 'School', 'Literature', 'Theatre', 'Read For School', 'Poetry', 'Tragedy']","['Iago', 'Bianca', 'Othello', 'Miguel Cássio', 'Desdêmona', 'Emilia', 'Rodrigo']","Paperback","","314","Simon Schuster","01/01/04","10/28/03","[]","315131","['99073', '114139', '77115', '19456', '5348']","92","['Venice (Italy)', 'Cyprus']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459795105l/12996._SY475_.jpg","47570","684",6.76

From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school.

Its figures harden their hearts, engage in violence, or try to alleviate the suffering of others. Lear himself rages until his sanity cracks. What, then, keeps bringing us back to King Lear? For all the force of its language, King Lear is almost equally powerful when translated, suggesting that it is the story, in large part, that draws us to the play.The play tells us about families struggling between greed and cruelty, on the one hand, and support and consolation, on the other. Emotions are extreme, magnified to gigantic proportions. We also see old age portrayed in all its vulnerability, pride, and, perhaps, wisdom—one reason this most devastating of Shakespeare’s tragedies is also perhaps his most moving.The authoritative edition of King Lear from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play-Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play-Scene-by-scene plot summaries-A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases-An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language-An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play-Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books-An annotated guide to further readingEssay by Susan SnyderThe Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.","English","9780385486804","['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Travel', 'Adventure', 'Classics', 'Memoir', 'Nature', 'Biography Memoir', 'School', 'Survival']","['Christopher McCandless']","Paperback","","207","Anchor Books","01/20/97","10/28/96","['Washington State Book Award (1997)']","878855","['318776', '322679', '169307', '44022', '24071']","92","['Mexico', 'Virginia (United States)', 'The Slabs, Mojave Desert, California (United States)', 'Alaska (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403173986l/1845.jpg","46018","583",3.75

The letters are all addressed to ""My dear and unfortunate successor,"" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of, a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself--to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.","English","B000FCK6EI","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Vampires', 'Historical', 'Paranormal', 'Gothic', 'Thriller']","['Bartholomew Rossi', 'Helen Rossi', 'Dracula']","Kindle Edition","","704","Little, Brown and Company","06/01/05","","['International Horror Guild Award Nominee for Best Novel (2005)', 'Hopwood Award for Novel in-progress (2003)', 'Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Best Adult Fiction (2006)', 'The Quill Award for Debut Author of the Year (2005)', 'Lord Ruthven Award for Fiction (2006)']","242366","['75804', '80135', '55143', '21396', '9888']","87","['Europe', 'Amsterdam (Netherlands)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1592232171l/30236962._SY475_.jpg","44792","542",""

Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong.

It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition.

For decades, Herriot roamed the remote, beautiful Yorkshire Dales, treating every patient that came his way from smallest to largest, and observing animals and humans alike with his keen, loving eye.In All Creatures Great and Small, we meet the young Herriot as he takes up his calling and discovers that the realities of veterinary practice in rural Yorkshire are very different from the sterile setting of veterinary school. Some visits are heart-wrenchingly difficult, such as one to an old man in the village whose very ill dog is his only friend and companion, some are lighthearted and fun, such as Herriot's periodic visits to the overfed and pampered Pekinese Tricki Woo who throws parties and has his own stationery, and yet others are inspirational and enlightening, such as Herriot's recollections of poor farmers who will scrape their meager earnings together to be able to get proper care for their working animals. From seeing to his patients in the depths of winter on the remotest homesteads to dealing with uncooperative owners and critically ill animals, Herriot discovers the wondrous variety and never-ending challenges of veterinary practice as his humor, compassion, and love of the animal world shine forth.James Herriot's memoirs have sold 80 million copies worldwide, and continue to delight and entertain readers of all ages","English","9780312965785","['Nonfiction', 'Animals', 'Memoir', 'Classics', 'Biography', 'Humor', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'British Literature', 'Audiobook']","['James Herriot', 'Siegfried Farnon', 'Tristan Farnon', 'Helen Alderson', 'Mrs. Hall', 'Mrs. Pumphrey', 'Tricky Woo', 'Granville Bennet', 'Diana Brompton', 'Herbert Jarvis', 'Broom', 'Charlie Dent', 'John Skipton', 'Copfield']","Mass Market Paperback","","437","St. Martin's Paperbacks","04/15/98","10/28/72","[]","114546","['58844', '37616', '14716', '2363', '1007']","97","['Yorkshire, England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393644607l/32085.jpg","43536","578",2.63

"40440.The_Thirteenth_Tale","The Thirteenth Tale","","Diane Setterfield (Goodreads Author)","3.97","All children mythologize their birth...So begins the prologue of reclusive author Vida Winter's collection of stories, which are as famous for the mystery of the missing thirteenth tale as they are for the delight and enchantment of the twelve that do exist. The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself -- all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission. As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire. Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves. The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children. Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.","English","9780743298025","['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Gothic', 'Books About Books', 'Adult', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction']","['Margaret Lea', 'Emmeline March', 'Adeline March', 'Vida Winter', 'Aurelius Love']","Hardcover","","406","Atria Books","09/12/06","","['Dilys Award Nominee (2007)', 'ALA Alex Award (2007)', 'The Quill Award for Debut Author (2007)']","272208","['93215', '101764', '57088', '14828', '5313']","93","['Angelfield (United Kingdom)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346267826l/40440.jpg","42961","522",1.76

Wells’s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.  Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells’s expert storytelling and provocative insight, The Time Machine will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come. ","English","9999999999999","['Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Novels']","['Gip', 'Weena', 'The Time Traveller']","Paperback","","118","Signet Classics","10/01/02","05/07/95","[]","412817","['119860', '159791', '106679', '21277', '5210']","94","['United Kingdom', 'London, England', 'England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327942880l/2493.jpg","42562","594",""

Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.","English","9781400079278","['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Japan', 'Fantasy', 'Japanese Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asia']","['Kafka Tamura', 'Sakura', 'Satoru Nakata', 'Oshima', 'Miss Saeki', 'Hoshino']","Paperback","","467","Vintage International","01/03/06","10/28/02","['World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (2006)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2005)', 'Independent Foreign Fiction Prize Nominee for Longlist (2006)', 'PEN Translation Prize for Philip Gabriel (2006)', 'Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis Nominee for Preis der Jugendjury (2005)', 'Tähtifantasia Award (2010)', 'Βραβείο Βιβλίου Public for Μεταφρασμένο μυθιστόρημα της χρονιάς (Translator: Αργυρώ Μαντόγλου) (2016)']","305688","['125586', '116603', '46868', '12046', '4585']","95","['Takamatsu (Japan)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429638085l/4929.jpg","41731","474",8.22

I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in.

"58345.The_Awakening","The Awakening","","Kate Chopin","3.65","When first published in 1899, The Awakening shocked readers with its honest treatment of female marital infidelity. Audiences accustomed to the pieties of late Victorian romantic fiction were taken aback by Chopin's daring portrayal of a woman trapped in a stifling marriage, who seeks and finds passionate physical love outside the confines of her domestic situation.Aside from its unusually frank treatment of a then-controversial subject, the novel is widely admired today for its literary qualities. Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work ""quite uninhibited and beautifully written, which anticipates D. H. Lawrence in its treatment of infidelity."" Although the theme of marital infidelity no longer shocks, few novels have plumbed the psychology of a woman involved in an illicit relationship with the perception, artistry, and honesty that Kate Chopin brought to The Awakening.","English","9780543898081","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Feminism', 'School', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Read For School', 'High School', 'American', '19th Century']","['Edna Pontellier', 'Léonce Pontellier', 'Robert Lebrun', 'Alcée Arobin', 'Adèle Ratignolle', 'Mademoiselle Reisz']","Paperback","","195","Elibron Classics","10/28/06","10/28/99","[]","170636","['45670', '55325', '43393', '17536', '8712']","85","['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)', 'Grand Isle, Louisiana (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170507247l/58345._SY475_.jpg","39307","501",10.36

Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.","English","9781400078776","['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'Literature', 'British Literature']","['Kathy H.', 'Ruth', 'Tommy']","Paperback","","288","Vintage Books","08/31/10","04/11/05","['Booker Prize Nominee (2005)', 'Locus Award Nominee for Best SF Novel (2006)', 'Arthur C.

When he awoke from his long sleep, he didn't know much more than his name. His brain fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight with the pen/sword in his pocket. Somehow Percy manages to make it to a camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he has to keep killing monsters along the way. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him. The only thing he can recall from his past is another name: Annabeth. HAZEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD. When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. Sure, she was an obedient daughter, even when her mother was possessed by greed. But that was the problem—when the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her ""gift"" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Hazel wishes she could ride away from it all on the stallion that appears in her dreams.FRANK IS A KLUTZ. His grandmother says he is descended from heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn't see it. He doesn't even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery—although not good enough to win camp war games. His bulky physique makes him feel like an ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely—enough to share the secret he holds close to his heart.Beginning at the ""other"" camp for half-bloods and extending as far as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all destined to play a part in the Prophesy of Seven.","English","9781423140597","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Adventure', 'Greek Mythology', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult Fantasy']","['Nico di Angelo', 'Octavian', 'Hera', 'Reyna', 'Juno', 'Hazel Levesque', 'Frank Zhang', 'Ella the Harpy', 'Percy Jackson']","Hardcover","First Edition","513","Disney ● Hyperion Books","10/04/11","","[""Buckeye Children's Book Award for 6-8 (2012)"", ""Goodreads Choice Award for Middle Grade & Children's and Nominee for Favorite Book (2011)""]","412823","['239125', '124167', '40367', '6527', '2637']","98","['Oakland, California (United States)', 'Alaska (United States)', 'Portland, Oregon (United States)', 'Seattle, Washington (United States)', 'Berkeley, California (United States)', 'North Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada)', 'Anchorage, Alaska (United States)', 'Seward, Alaska (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1464201114l/9520360._SY475_.jpg","37699","476",6.42

"14942.Mrs_Dalloway","Mrs. Dalloway","","Virginia Woolf, Maureen Howard (Foreword)","3.79","Heralded as Virginia Woolf's greatest novel, this is a vivid portrait of a single day in a woman's life. When we meet her, Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of party preparation while in her mind she is something much more than a perfect society hostess. As she readies her house, she is flooded with remembrances of faraway times. And, met with the realities of the present, Clarissa reexamines the choices that brought her there, hesitantly looking ahead to the unfamiliar work of growing old.""Mrs. Dalloway was the first novel to split the atom. If the novel before Mrs. Dalloway aspired to immensities of scope and scale, to heroic journeys across vast landscapes, with Mrs. Dalloway Virginia Woolf insisted that it could also locate the enormous within the everyday; that a life of errands and party-giving was every bit as viable a subject as any life lived anywhere; and that should any human act in any novel seem unimportant, it has merely been inadequately observed. The novel as an art form has not been the same since.""Mrs. Dalloway also contains some of the most beautiful, complex, incisive and idiosyncratic sentences ever written in English, and that alone would be reason enough to read it. It is one of the most moving, revolutionary artworks of the twentieth century.""--Michael Cunningham, author of The Hours","English","9780151009985","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'British Literature', 'Feminism', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'School', 'English Literature']","['Clarissa Dalloway', 'Septimus Warren Smith', 'Peter Walsh', 'Sally Seton']","Hardcover","","194","Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","10/28/02","05/14/25","[]","223466","['69268', '73976', '52263', '19285', '8674']","87","['London, England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479336522l/14942._SY475_.jpg","35980","477",1.33

Salinger","3.98","The short story, Franny, takes place in an unnamed college town and tells the tale of an undergraduate who is becoming disenchanted with the selfishness and inauthenticity she perceives all around her.The novella, Zooey, is named for Zooey Glass, the second-youngest member of the Glass family. As his younger sister, Franny, suffers a spiritual and existential breakdown in her parents' Manhattan living room -- leaving Bessie, her mother, deeply concerned -- Zooey comes to her aid, offering what he thinks is brotherly love, understanding, and words of sage advice.Salinger writes of these works: ""FRANNY came out in The New Yorker in 1955, and was swiftly followed, in 1957 by ZOOEY. Both stories are early, critical entries in a narrative series I'm doing about a family of settlers in twentieth-century New York, the Glasses. It is a long-term project, patently an ambiguous one, and there is a real-enough danger, I suppose that sooner or later I'll bog down, perhaps disappear entirely, in my own methods, locutions, and mannerisms. On the whole, though, I'm very hopeful. I love working on these Glass stories, I've been waiting for them most of my life, and I think I have fairly decent, monomaniacal plans to finish them with due care and all-available skill.""","English","9780316769020","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']","['Franny Glass', 'Zooey Glass', 'Buddy Glass', 'Lane Coutell', 'Bessie Glass']","Paperback","","201","Back Bay Books","01/30/01","10/28/55","['National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1962)']","185569","['66977', '64597', '39931', '10853', '3211']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355037988l/5113.jpg","35744","457",4.19

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.","English","9780765326355","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adventure']","['Kaladin Stormblessed', 'Dalinar Kholin', 'Shallan Davar', 'Jasnah Kholin', 'Adolin Kholin', 'Hoid']","Hardcover","","1007","Tor Books","08/31/10","","['Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'David Gemmell Legend Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'Whitney Award for Best Novel (2010)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy and for Favorite Book and for Goodreads Author (2010)']","302877","['221465', '60345', '14100', '4101', '2866']","98","['Roshar']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388184640l/7235533.jpg","34012","359",22.74

"8921.The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles","The Hound of the Baskervilles","Sherlock Holmes #5","Arthur Conan Doyle, Anne Perry (Afterword)","4.12","We owe The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902) to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher ""Bobbles"" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs? Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's ""a real Creeper!"" What distinguishes this particular Hound is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,"" Watson realizes. ""Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.""

Ultimately, of course, something has to give.Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects:  Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven.

The Quran is composed of verses (Ayat) that make up 114 chapters (suras) of unequal length which are classified either as Meccan (المكية) or Medinan (المدنية) depending upon the place and time of their claimed revelation. Muslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through the angel Jibrīl (Gabriel) from God to Muhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.Muslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah or Pentateuch) of Moses, the Zabur (Tehillim or Book of Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events.

Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry. This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman.

Surviving an attempt on her life wasn't pleasant, but at least she got a guardian angel out of it. A mysterious, magnetic, gorgeous guardian angel. But despite his role in her life, Patch has been acting anything but angelic. He's more elusive than ever (if that's possible) and what's worse, he seems to be spending time with Nora's archenemy, Marcie Millar.Nora would have hardly noticed Scott Parnell, an old family friend who has moved back to town, if Patch hadn't been acting so distant. Even with Scott's totally infuriating attitude, Nora finds herself drawn to him - despite her lingering feelings that he is hiding something.If that weren't enough, Nora is haunted by images of her murdered father, and comes to question whether her Nephilim bloodline has anything to do with his death. Desperate to figure out what happened, she puts herself in increasingly dangerous situations to get the answer. But maybe some things are better left buried, because the truth could destroy everything - and everyone - she trusts.","English","9781416989431","['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Angels', 'Paranormal', 'Romance', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Supernatural', 'Fiction', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Young Adult Fantasy']","['Nora Grey', 'Jev ""Patch"" Cipriano', 'Vee Sky', 'Marcie Millar', 'Rixon', 'Scott Parnell']","Hardcover","First Edition","432","Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers","10/19/10","","['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Goodreads Author (2010)']","274616","['117941', '80081', '52264', '17540', '6790']","91","['Coldwater, Maine (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362408146l/7791997.jpg","28887","357",5.8

"4406.East_of_Eden","East of Eden","","John Steinbeck","4.38","In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden “the first book,” and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.--jacket flap","English","9780142000656","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', 'Adult']","['Mr. Edwards', 'Ethel', 'Lee', 'Faye', 'Tom Hamilton', 'Cyrus Trask', 'Mrs. Trask', 'Alice Trask', 'Adam Trask', 'Charles Trask', 'Aron Trask', 'Caleb Trask', 'Samuel Hamilton', 'Liza Hamilton', 'George Hamilton', 'Will Hamilton', 'Joe Hamilton', 'Lizzie Hamilton', 'Una Hamilton', 'Dessie Hamilton', 'Olive Hamilton', 'Mollie Hamilton', 'Cathy Ames', 'Abra Bacon', 'Joe Valery']","Paperback","Steinbeck Centennial Edition (US / CAN)","601","Penguin Books","10/28/02","10/28/52","['Audie Award for Classic (2004)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1953)']","428907","['246230', '119358', '46605', '11428', '5286']","96","['California (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544744853l/4406.jpg","28764","344",5.26
"49628.Cloud_Atlas","Cloud Atlas","","David Mitchell","4.01","A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.","English","9780375507250","['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical']","['Adam Ewing', 'Autua', 'Dr. Goose', 'Robert Frobisher', 'Rufus Sixsmith', 'Vyvyan Ayrs', 'Jocasta Ayrs', 'Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck', 'Luisa Rey', 'Timothy Cavendish', 'Sonmi~451', 'Zachry', 'Meronym', 'Hae-Joo Im', 'Mr. Meeks', 'Ernie Blacksmith', 'Nurse Noakes', 'Javier Gomez', 'Fay Li', 'Bill Smoke', 'Joe Napier', 'Yoona-939', 'Isaac Sachs', 'Old Georgie']","Paperback","First US Edition","509","Random House","08/17/04","03/28/04","['Booker Prize Nominee (2004)', 'Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (2004)', 'Locus Award Nominee for Best SF Novel (2005)', 'Arthur C.

Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.Not much later, Jake’s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insane—and insanely possible—mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jake’s life—a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.","English","9781451627282","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Mystery']","['John F.

In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.","English","9999999999999","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'France', 'Literature', 'French Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Africa']","['Raoul', 'Dr Bernard Rieux', 'Father Paneloux', 'Joseph Grand', 'Raymond Rambert', 'Jean Tarrou', 'Cottard', 'M.

"386187.Midnight_in_the_Garden_of_Good_and_Evil","Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil","","John Berendt","3.92","A sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the ""soul of pampered self-absorption""; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.","English","9780679751526","['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'History', 'Southern', 'Classics', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook']","['Jim Williams', 'Danny Hansford']","Paperback","","386","Vintage","06/28/99","01/13/94","['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for General Nonfiction (1995)', 'Exclusive Books Boeke Prize (1995)', 'Ferro-Grumley Award for Gay Fiction (Non-Fiction) (1994)', ""Lambda Literary Award for Gay Men's Mystery (1995)""]","223939","['67102', '89467', '52483', '11519', '3368']","93","['Savannah, Georgia (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427166915l/386187.jpg","25322","357",4.43

The story famously recounts how the faded and promiscuous Blanche DuBois is pushed over the edge by her sexy and brutal brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. Streetcar launched the careers of Marlon Brando, Jessica Tandy, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden, and solidified the position of Tennessee Williams as one of the most important young playwrights of his generation, as well as that of Elia Kazan as the greatest American stage director of the ’40s and ’50s.","English","9780822210894","['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Theatre', 'American', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'High School']","['Blanche DuBois', 'Stanley Kowalski', 'Stella Kowalski', 'Harold Mitchel', 'Eunice Hubbel', 'Steve Hubbel', 'Pablo Gonzales', 'Negro Woman', 'Baby', 'Matron', 'Doctor', 'Mexican Woman', 'Young Collector']","Paperback","","107","Dramatists Play Service","12/01/52","10/28/47","['Pulitzer Prize for Drama (1948)', ""New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best American Play (1948)""]","261257","['92878', '94157', '55892', '13926', '4404']","93","['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389153133l/12220.jpg","25241","386",5.26
"6759.Infinite_Jest","Infinite Jest","","David Foster Wallace","4.28","A gargantuan, mind-altering tragi-comedy about the Pursuit of Happiness in America. Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human—and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.","English","9780316921176","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Humor', 'Unfinished', 'Literary Fiction', 'American', 'Philosophy']","['Hal Incadenza', 'Joelle Van Dyne', 'Michael Pemulis', 'Mario Incandenza', 'Ken Erdedy', 'Avril Incandenza', 'Orin Incandenza', 'Randy Lenz', 'Ortho Stice', 'Tiny Ewell', 'Poor Tony Krause', 'Clenette Henderson', 'Remy Marathe', 'Hugh Steeply', 'Pat Montesian', 'Ann Kittenplan', 'Trevor Axford', 'LaMont Chu', 'Geoffrey Day', 'Gerhardt Schtitt', 'Ted Schacht', 'Dr. James Orin Incandenza', 'Katherine Ann Gompert', 'Dr. Charles Tavis', 'Mildred L.

Hence: Can Machiavelli, who makes the following observations, be Machiavellian as we understand the disparaging term? 1. So it is that to know the nature of a people, one need be a Prince; to know the nature of a Prince, one need to be of the people. 2. If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him. 3. Opportunity made Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others; their virtue domi-nated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Armed prophets win; the disarmed lose. 4. Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory. 5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression. 6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope. 7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters, 8. Nations based on mercenary forces will never be solid or secure. 9. Mercenaries are dangerous because of their cowardice 10. There are two ways to fight: one with laws, the other with force. The first is rightly man’s way; the second, the way of beasts.","English","9780937832387","['Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Literature', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'School']","['Theseus (mythology)', 'Alexander the Great', 'Cesare Borgia', 'Francesco Sforza', 'Niccolò Machiavelli', 'Pope Alexander VI', 'Louis XII of France']","Paperback","","140","Dante University of America Press","06/01/03","10/28/32","['National Book Award Finalist for Translation (1978)']","259962","['76212', '90803', '68095', '18695', '6157']","90","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390055828l/28862.jpg","25150","352",5.68

"8664353-unbroken","Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption","","Laura Hillenbrand","4.36","In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man's journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit. On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.","English","9781400064168","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'War', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Military Fiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']","['Louie Zamperini', 'Russell Allen Phillips', 'Pete Zamperini', 'Stanley Pillsbury', 'Harry Brooks', 'Payton Jordan', 'Anthony Zamperini', 'Louise Zamperini', 'Francis McNamara (Mac)', 'William Harris', 'Fred Garrett', 'Frank Tinker', 'Thorbjørn Christiansen', 'Sylvia Zamperini Flammer', 'Virginia Zamperini', 'Lynn Moody', 'Cecy Perry', 'Cynthia Zamperini (Applewhite)', 'Harry Read', 'Yukichi Kano']","Hardcover","","492","Random House","11/16/10","","['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography (2010)', ""Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award Nominee for Young Adults (2014)"", 'Indies Choice Book Award for Nonfiction (2011)', 'Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for NonFiction (2011)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2015)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History and Biography (2010)']","767063","['452057', '202821', '71163', '21654', '19368']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327861115l/8664353.jpg","24200","290",1.15

She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that eight hundred pages leave readers longing for more.English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.","English","9999999999999","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Magic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Alternate History', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Magical Realism']","['Jonathan Strange', 'Gilbert Norrell', 'George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron', 'John Uskglass (The Raven King)', 'John Childermass', 'Vinculus', 'Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool', 'Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington', 'Stephen Black', 'John Segundus', 'Mr. Honeyfoot', 'Mrs. Honeyfoot', 'Christopher Drawlight', 'Henry Lascelles', 'Jeremy Johns', 'Arabella Woodhope Strange', 'Laurence Strange', 'Sir Walter Pole', 'Lady Emma Wintertowne Pole', 'Henry Woodhope', 'John Hyde', 'Dr. Lancelot Greysteel', 'Louisa Greysteel', 'Flora Greysteel', 'Mrs Delgado', 'Napoleon Bonaparte']","Paperback","First Tor Edition","1006","Tor Books","08/01/06","09/08/04","['Hugo Award for Best Novel (2005)', 'Booker Prize Nominee for Longlist (2004)', 'Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (2005)', 'Locus Award for Best First Novel and Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2005)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2004)', 'World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (2005)', 'Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature (2005)', 'Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction (2005)', 'British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (2005)', 'Cena Akademie SFFH for Kniha roku (Book of the Year) (2007)']","198407","['69345', '62077', '39162', '17558', '10265']","86","['United Kingdom']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357027589l/14201._SY475_.jpg","23949","296",""

Once caught in its pages, there's no escaping Longfellow's terrible tale. Weeks ago, she was one of Hollywood's biggest writers, wed to one of its greatest stars. The doting mother of their golden child. But now? She's alone, tortured by a horrifying secret no woman could bear. Pursued by those she can't outrun, anguished by a guilt she can't endure, and driven close to madness, she flees to the one place she's ever called home: a small town in Vermont where River House still stands. To a child, the splendid hotel was mysterious and magical and all its glamorous guests knew delicious secrets. Cocooned in its walls, she will write one last book. Her atonement? Or her suicide note? But life is never as you dream it, and River House isn't what she'd always imagined it was. Intense, literary, and harrowing, Houdini Heart is a tale of bone-chilling horror, emotional torment, and psychological terror. Gripped by River House, trapped in an aging hotel of mirrors only Houdini could escape, how much can haunt a mind before it too is only a thing once imagined?

And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families. Nineteen Minutes is New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you? What does it mean to be different in our society? Is it ever okay for a victim to strike back? And who -- if anyone -- has the right to judge someone else?","English","9780743496728","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Drama', 'Young Adult', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime']","['Josie Cormier', 'Alex Cormier', 'Lacy Houghton', 'Lewis Houghton', 'Peter Houghton', 'Jordan McAfee', 'Patrick Ducharme']","Hardcover","","440","Atria Books","03/05/07","","['Iowa High School Book Award (2010)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2010)', 'LovelyBooks Leserpreis Nominee for Allgemeine Literatur (2009)']","300559","['122363', '111834', '52440', '10680', '3242']","95","['New Hampshire (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348577596l/14866.jpg","22630","287",2.66

"397483.The_Devil_in_the_White_City","The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America","","Erik Larson (Goodreads Author)","3.99","Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil in the White City' is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous ""White City"" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe","English","9780609608449","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook', 'American History', 'Biography', 'Book Club']","['Daniel Burnham', 'H.H.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity.

Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched.","English","9780679764021","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Romance', 'Classics', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction']","['Kabuo Miyamoto', 'Ishmael Chambers', 'Hatsue Miyamoto', 'Carl Heine']","Paperback","","460","Vintage","09/26/95","09/12/94","['Anthony Award Nominee for Best First Novel (1995)', 'PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction (1995)', 'American Booksellers Book Of The Year  Award for Adult Trade (1996)', 'Martin Beck Award (1996)', 'Barnes and Noble Discover Great New Writers Award (1994)']","166026","['44802', '66217', '41740', '10326', '2941']","92","['San Piedro Island, Washington (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479863528l/77142.jpg","19933","285",1.79

Daß dieses im Herbst 1917 vollendete Buch erst im Juni 1919, ein halbes Jahr nach Kriegsende, veröffentlicht wurde, lag an der Unbekanntheit des Verfassers. Denn Hesse hatte das Manuskript dem Verlag als das Erstlingswerk eines kranken jungen Dichters empfohlen, des zeitkritischen Poeten Emil Sinclair, der bisher nur in Zeitungen und Zeitschriften durch pazifistische Mahnrufe und Erzählungen aufgefallen war (die gleichfalls von Hesse stammten). Doch trotz des Inkognitos erlebte das Buch eine geradezu stürmische Aufnahme und wurde noch im Erscheinungsjahr mit dem Fontane-Preis für das beste Erstlingswerk eines Nachwuchsautors ausgezeichnet. Thomas Mann verglich die elektrisierende Wirkung des Buches mit der von Goethes Werther, da es »mit unheimlicher Genauigkeit den Nerv der Zeit traf und eine ganze Jugend, die wähnte aus ihrer Mitte sei ihr ein Künder ihres tiefsten Lebens entstanden, zu dankbarem Entzücken hinriß«.

Burton's multivolume translation, and includes Burton's extensive and acclaimed explanatory notes. The tales of told by Shahrazad over a thousand and one nights to delay her execution by the vengeful King Shahriyar have become among the most popular in both Eastern and Western literature, as recounted by Sir Francis Burton. From the epic adventures of ""Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp"" to the farcical ""Young Woman and her Five Lovers"" and the social criticism of ""The Tale of the Hunchback"", the stories depict a fabulous world of all-powerful sorcerers, jinns imprisoned in bottles and enchanting princesses. But despite their imaginative extravagance, the Tales are anchored to everyday life by their realism, providing a full and intimate record of medieval Islam.'","English","9780812972146","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Fairy Tales', 'Mythology', 'Adventure', 'Folklore', 'Childrens']","[]","Paperback","Abridged; Modern Library Edition","1049","Modern Library","06/01/04","10/28/15","[]","61139","['23750', '21192', '12396', '2678', '1123']","94","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388212809l/93101.jpg","18263","256",2.43

Not until the 1955 publication of The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson, a three-volume critical edition compiled by Thomas H.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.","English","9780307346605","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Zombies', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Apocalyptic', 'War']","['Zombies', 'Kwang Jing-shu', 'Nury Televaldi', 'Stanley MacDonald', 'Todd Wainio', 'Maria Zhuganova', 'Jesika Hendricks', 'Joe Muhammad']","Hardcover","","342","Crown","09/12/06","","['Audie Award for Multi-Voiced Performance (2014)', 'Premio Ignotus Nominee for Mejor novela extranjera (Best Foreign Novel) (2009)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2012)', 'Seiun Award 星雲賞 Nominee for Best Translated Long Form (2011)']","439825","['168192', '153281', '83042', '25068', '10242']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647l/8908._SX318_.jpg","17610","222",5.58

"11901.The_Witching_Hour","The Witching Hour","Lives of the Mayfair Witches #1","Anne Rice","4.11","From the author of the extraordinary Vampire Chronicles comes a huge, hypnotic novel of witchcraft and the occult through four centuries.Demonstrating, once again, her gift for spellbinding storytelling and the creation of legend, Anne Rice makes real for us a great dynasty of witches—a family given to poetry and to incest, to murder and to philosophy; a family that, over the ages, is itself haunted by a powerful, dangerous, and seductive being.On the veranda of a great New Orleans house, now faded, a mute and fragile woman sits rocking... and The Witching Hour begins.It begins in our time with a rescue at sea.  Rowan Mayfair, a beautiful woman, a brilliant practitioner of neurosurgery—aware that she has special powers but unaware that she comes from an ancient line of witches—finds the drowned body of a man off the coast of California and brings him to life.  He is Michael Curry, who was born in New Orleans and orphaned in childhood by fire on Christmas Eve, who pulled himself up from poverty, and who now, in his brief interval of death, has acquired a sensory power that mystifies and frightens him.As these two, fiercely drawn to each other, fall in love and—in passionate alliance—set out to solve the mystery of her past and his unwelcome gift, the novel moves backward and forward in time from today's New Orleans and San Francisco to long-ago Amsterdam and a château in the France of Louis XIV.  An intricate tale of evil unfolds—an evil unleashed in seventeenth-century Scotland, where the first ""witch,"" Suzanne of the Mayfair, conjures up the spirit she names Lasher... a creation that spells her own destruction and torments each of her descendants in turn.From the coffee plantations of Port au Prince, where the great Mayfair fortune is made and the legacy of their dark power is almost destroyed, to Civil War New Orleans, as Julien—the clan's only male to be endowed with occult powers—provides for the dynasty its foothold in America, the dark, luminous story encompasses dramas of seduction and death, episodes of tenderness and healing.  And always—through peril and escape, tension and release—there swirl around us the echoes of eternal war: innocence versus the corruption of the spirit, sanity against madness, life against death.  With a dreamlike power, the novel draws us, through circuitous, twilight paths, to the present and Rowan's increasingly inspired and risky moves in the merciless game that binds her to her heritage. And in New Orleans, on Christmas Eve, this strangest of family sagas is brought to its startling climax.","English","9780099471424","['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal', 'Witches', 'Supernatural', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Gothic', 'Magic', 'Adult']","['Rowan Mayfair', 'Michael James Timothy Curry', 'Aaron Lightner', 'Lasher', 'Deirdre Mayfair', 'Stella Mayfair', 'Mary Beth Mayfair', 'Antha Mayfair', 'Carlotta Mayfair', 'Ellie Mayfair', 'Julien Mayfair', 'Marie Claudette Mayfair Landry', 'Angélique Mayfair', 'Katherine Mayfair', 'Remy Mayfair', 'Graham Franklin', 'Lionel Mayfair', 'Belle Mayfair', 'Darcy Monahan', 'Sean Lacy', 'Petyr van Abel', 'Deborah Mayfair de Montcleve', 'Suzanne Mayfair', 'Lestan Mayfair', 'Marguerite Mayfair', 'Tyrone Clifford McNamara', 'Augustin Mayfair', 'Jeannette Mayfair', 'Cortland Mayfair', 'Barclay Mayfair', 'Garland Mayfair', 'Corrington Mayfair', 'Daniel McIntyre', 'Nancy Mayfair', 'Millie Mayfair', 'Amanda Grady Mayfair', 'Sean McIntyre', 'Alice Mayfair']","Paperback","","1207","Arrow","11/04/04","10/01/90","['Locus Award for Best Dark Fantasy/Horror Novel (1991)']","101853","['45573', '31301', '17509', '5293', '2177']","93","['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)', 'Louisiana (United States)', 'Scotland Yard, London, England (United Kingdom)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327289387l/11901.jpg","17529","235",5.92

"6150.Cry_the_Beloved_Country","Cry, the Beloved Country","","Alan Paton","3.89","Cry, the Beloved Country, the most famous and important novel in South Africa’s history, was an immediate worldwide bestseller in 1948. Alan Paton’s impassioned novel about a black man’s country under white man’s law is a work of searing beauty.Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or valley. For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.The eminent literary critic Lewis Gannett wrote, “We have had many novels from statesmen and reformers, almost all bad; many novels from poets, almost all thin. In Alan Paton’s Cry, the Beloved Country the statesman, the poet and the novelist meet in a unique harmony.” Cry, the Beloved Country is the deeply moving story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son, Absalom, set against the background of a land and a people riven by racial injustice. Remarkable for its lyricism, unforgettable for character and incident, Cry, the Beloved Country is a classic work of love and hope, courage and endurance, born of the dignity of man.","English","9780743261951","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Africa', 'Historical Fiction', 'South Africa', 'Literature', 'School', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Read For School']","['Stephen Kumalo', 'Absalom Kumalo', 'Msimangu', 'James Jarvis']","Hardcover","","316","Scribner","11/25/03","10/28/48","['Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Fiction (1949)']","67315","['22704', '23553', '14301', '4742', '2015']","90","['South Africa']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344182368l/6150.jpg","17296","237",6.56

Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell. Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos. This smart, sophisticated story harks back to the novels of Anne Rice, but it is as contemporary and sensual as the Twilight series-with an extra serving of historical realism.","English","9780670022410","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Vampires', 'Witches', 'Magic', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Supernatural']","['Sarah Bishop', 'Sean Ryder', 'Diana Bishop', 'Matthew Clairmont', 'Emily Mather', 'Miriam Shephard', 'Hamish Osborne', 'Marcus Whitmore', 'Ysabeau de Clermont', 'Baldwin de Clairmont', 'Elias Ashmole', 'Peter Knox', 'Stephen Proctor', 'Rebecca Bishop', 'Juliette Durand', 'Agatha Wilson', 'Nathaniel Wilson', 'Gillian Chamberlain', 'Marthe (Vampire)', 'Chris Roberts']","Hardcover","","579","Viking Penguin","02/28/11","","['SCIBA Award for fiction', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Paranormal Fantasy and for Favorite Book and for Goodreads Author (2011)']","369030","['152161', '116340', '62586', '24174', '13769']","90","['Oxford, England', 'Saint Lucien (France)', 'Madison, New York (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525097370l/8667848._SY475_.jpg","16633","198",10.0

But since its original prewar translation there has been no completely new version in English. Now, Penguin brings Proust's masterpiece to new audiences throughout the world, beginning with Lydia Davis's internationally acclaimed translation of the first volume, Swann's Way.Swann's Way is one of the preeminent novels of childhood: a sensitive boy's impressions of his family and neighbors, all brought dazzlingly back to life years later by the taste of a madeleine. It also enfolds the short novel ""Swann in Love,"" an incomparable study of sexual jealousy that becomes a crucial part of the vast, unfolding structure of In Search of Lost Time. The first volume of the work that established Proust as one of the finest voices of the modern age — satirical, skeptical, confiding, and endlessly varied in its response to the human condition — Swann's Way also stands on its own as a perfect rendering of a life in art, of the past re-created through memory.","English","9780142437964","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'France', 'Literature', 'French Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Philosophy', 'Literary Fiction', 'Unfinished']","['Narrator/Marcel', 'Baron de Charlus', 'Mme Swann', 'Gilberte Swann', 'Cottard', 'Odette de Crécy', 'Charles Swann', 'Françoise de Combray', 'Madame Verdurin']","Paperback","","444","Penguin Classics","11/30/04","11/14/13","['French-American Foundation Translation Prize for Fiction (2003)', 'Премія «Сковорода» (2001)']","47095","['22484', '13680', '6689', '2624', '1618']","91","['France', 'Combray (France)', 'Balbec (France)', 'Paris (France)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452956236l/12749._SY475_.jpg","16418","205",7.97

If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form.

As Williams's first popular success, it launched the brilliant, if somewhat controversial, career, of our pre-eminent lyric playwright. Since its premiere in Chicago in 1944, with the legendary Laurette Taylor in the role of Amanda, Menagaerie has been the bravura piece for great actresses from Jessica Tandy to Joanne Woodward, and is studied and performed in classrooms and theatres around the world. The Glass Menagerie (in the reading text the author preferred) is now available only in its New Directions Paperbook edition. A new introduction by the editor of The Tennessee Williams Annual Review, Robert Bray, reappraises the play more than half a century after it won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. This edition of The Glass Menagerie also includes Williams's essay on the impact of sudden fame on a struggling writer, ""The Catastrophe of Success,"" as well as a short section of Williams's own ""Production Notes.""

It is an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.","English","9780316055437","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Art', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Literature']","['Boris Pavlikovsky (The Goldfinch)', 'Theo Decker', 'Pippa', 'Hobie']","Hardcover","First American Edition","771","Little, Brown","10/22/13","09/23/13","['Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2014)', 'Audie Award for Literary Fiction (2014)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (2013)', 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) Nominee for International Book (2014)', ""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee (2014)"", 'Andrew Carnegie Medal for Fiction (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2013)']","719757","['265295', '236366', '138388', '51883', '27825']","89","['Amsterdam (Netherlands)', 'Las Vegas, Nevada (United States)', 'New York City, New York (United States)', ""New York City's Upper East Side (United States)""]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378710146l/17333223.jpg","14278","168",4.53
"5527.All_the_King_s_Men","All the King's Men","","Robert Penn Warren","4.07","More than just a classic political novel, Warren’s tale of power and corruption in the Depression-era South is a sustained meditation on the unforeseen consequences of every human act, the vexing connectedness of all people and the possibility—it’s not much of one—of goodness in a sinful world. Willie Stark, Warren’s lightly disguised version of Huey Long, the one time Louisiana strongman/governor, begins as a genuine tribune of the people and ends as a murderous populist demagogue. Jack Burden is his press agent, who carries out the boss’s orders, first without objection, then in the face of his own increasingly troubled conscience. And the politics? For Warren, that’s simply the arena most likely to prove that man is a fallen creature.

Leif Enger's debut, Peace Like a River, is one such work. His richly evocative novel, narrated by an asthmatic 11-year-old named Reuben Land, is the story of Reuben's unusual family and their journey across the frozen Badlands of the Dakotas in search of his fugitive older brother. Charged with the murder of two locals who terrorized their family, Davy has fled, understanding that the scales of justice will not weigh in his favor. But Reuben, his father, Jeremiah—a man of faith so deep he has been known to produce miracles—and Reuben's little sister, Swede, follow closely behind the fleeing Davy.Affecting and dynamic, Peace Like a River is at once a tragedy, a romance, and an unflagging exploration into the spirituality and magic possible in the everyday world, and in that of the world awaiting us on the other side of life. In Enger's superb debut effort, we witness a wondrous celebration of family, faith, and spirit, the likes of which we haven't seen in a long, long time—and the birth of a classic work of literature.","English","9780802139252","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Coming Of Age', 'Family']","['Rube Land', 'Swede Land', 'Davy Land', 'Jeremiah Land']","Paperback","","312","Atlantic Monthly Press","08/07/02","10/28/01","['Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction (2002)', 'Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) for Fiction - General (2002)', 'ALA Alex Award (2002)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2003)']","78941","['28708', '28610', '15746', '4313', '1564']","93","['United States of America', 'North Dakota (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436139976l/227571._SY475_.jpg","13833","168",2.86

These narrative threads wind sinuously across a vast, richly detailed tapestry of the violent, sensual world of vampirism, taking us back 6,000 years to its beginnings.  As the stories of the ""first brood"" of blood drinkers are revealed, we are swept across the ages, from Egypt to South America to the Himalayas to all the shrouded corners of the globe where vampires have left their mark. Vampires are created--mortals succumbing to the sensation of ""being enptied, of being devoured, of being nothing."" Vampires are destroyed.  Dark rituals are performed--the rituals of ancient creatures prowling the modern world.  And, finally, we are brought to a moment in the twentieth century when, in an astonishing climax, the fate of the living dead--and perhaps of the living, all the living--will be decided.From the Hardcover edition.","English","9780345419620","['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Vampires', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal', 'Supernatural', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Gothic', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']","['Lestat de Lioncourt', 'Gabrielle de Lioncourt', 'Maharet', 'Akasha', 'Enkil', 'Mael', 'Khayman', 'Jesse Miriam Reeves', 'Marius de Romanus', 'Daniel Molloy', 'Louis de Pointe du Lac', 'Armand']","Paperback","","448","Ballantine Books","11/29/97","10/28/88","['Bram Stoker Award Nominee for Best Novel (1988)', 'Locus Award Nominee for Best Horror Novel (1989)']","136927","['44708', '45811', '34899', '9086', '2423']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327871992l/43758.jpg","13322","192",3.64

Baconians are trying to convince the world that Francis Bacon really wrote Shakespeare, there are riots between the Surrealists and Impressionists, and thousands of men are named John Milton, an homage to the real Milton and a very confusing situation for the police. Amidst all this, Acheron Hades, Third Most Wanted Man In the World, steals the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit and kills a minor character, who then disappears from every volume of the novel ever printed! But that's just a prelude . . .Hades' real target is the beloved Jane Eyre, and it's not long before he plucks her from the pages of Bronte's novel. Enter Thursday Next. She's the Special Operative's renowned literary detective, and she drives a Porsche. With the help of her uncle Mycroft's Prose Portal, Thursday enters the novel to rescue Jane Eyre from this heinous act of literary homicide. It's tricky business, all these interlopers running about Thornfield, and deceptions run rampant as their paths cross with Jane, Rochester, and Miss Fairfax. Can Thursday save Jane Eyre and Bronte's masterpiece? And what of the Crimean War? Will it ever end? And what about those annoying black holes that pop up now and again, sucking things into time-space voids . . .Suspenseful and outlandish, absorbing and fun, The Eyre Affair is a caper unlike any other and an introduction to the imagination of a most distinctive writer and his singular fictional universe.","English","9780142001806","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Humor', 'Science Fiction', 'Books About Books', 'Time Travel', 'Alternate History', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult']","['Thursday Next', 'Jane Eyre', 'Acheron Hades', 'Jack Schitt', 'Landen Parke-Laine', 'Pickwick', 'Emma, Lady Hamilton', ""Thursday's Dad (name unknown)"", 'Braxton Hicks', 'Mrs. Nakajima', 'Joffy Next', 'Polly Next', 'Wednesday Next', 'Spike Stoker', 'Mycroft Next', 'Edward Rochester']","Paperback","","374","Penguin Books","02/25/03","07/19/01","['Locus Award Nominee for Best Science Fiction Novel (2002)', 'IAFA William L.

But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes:Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson.

"78433.The_Blind_Assassin","The Blind Assassin","","Margaret Atwood (Goodreads Author)","3.95","Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and clichés of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time. Like The Handmaid's Tale, it is destined to become a classic.","English","9999999999999","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Canada', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical']","['Iris Chase', 'Laura Chase', 'Alex Thomas', 'Richard Griffen']","Paperback","","637","Virago Press Ltd","09/03/01","09/02/00","['Booker Prize (2000)', 'Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Shortlist (2001)', 'Hammett Prize (2000)', 'Puddly Award for New Novel (2001)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (2002)']","136040","['45572', '51969', '28122', '7473', '2904']","92","['Canada', 'Toronto, Ontario (Canada)', 'Southwest Ontario (Canada)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451445426l/78433.jpg","12744","174",""

The novel is full of esoteric references to the Kabbalah. The title of the book refers to an actual pendulum designed by the French physicist Léon Foucault to demonstrate the rotation of the earth, which has symbolic significance within the novel.Bored with their work, and after reading too many manuscripts about occult conspiracy theories, three vanity publisher employees (Belbo, Diotallevi and Casaubon) invent their own conspiracy for fun. They call this satirical intellectual game ""The Plan,"" a hoax that connects the medieval Knights Templar with other occult groups from ancient to modern times. This produces a map indicating the geographical point from which all the powers of the earth can be controlled—a point located in Paris, France, at Foucault’s Pendulum. But in a fateful turn the joke becomes all too real.The three become increasingly obsessed with The Plan, and sometimes forget that it's just a game. Worse still, other conspiracy theorists learn about The Plan, and take it seriously. Belbo finds himself the target of a real secret society that believes he possesses the key to the lost treasure of the Knights Templar.Orchestrating these and other diverse characters into his multilayered semioticadventure, Eco has created a superb cerebral entertainment.","English","9780156032971","['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Thriller', 'Novels', 'Italy', 'Philosophy']","['Jacopo Belbo', 'Diotallevi', 'Casaubon', 'Signor Casaubon', 'Belbo', 'Dr. Diotallevi', 'Aglie', 'Sergei Witte', 'Elie de Cyon', 'Mary Lena', 'Hugues de Champagne', 'Artois', 'Gabriel Naudé', 'de Maistre', 'Theo Fox', 'Dufy', 'Abbé Barruel', 'Monsieur Rodin', 'Philippe Nizier Anselme Vachot', 'Péladan', 'Justine Glinka', 'Leo Fox']","Paperback","","623","Mariner Books","03/05/07","10/28/88","['PEN Translation Prize for William Weaver (1990)', 'Premio Bancarella (1989)', 'Ars Translationis (1998)']","59687","['20980', '19929', '12354', '4379', '2045']","89","['Italy', 'Milan (Italy)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1396645125l/17841.jpg","12708","166",4.3

Italo Calvino's novel is in one sense a comedy in which the two protagonists, the Reader and the Other Reader, ultimately end up married, having almost finished If on a Winter's Night a Traveler. In another, it is a tragedy, a reflection on the difficulties of writing and the solitary nature of reading. The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: ""Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade."" Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next.The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches—stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition—with explorations of how and why we choose to read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. If on a Winter's Night is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic. ""What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space.""","English","9780088619451","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Literature', 'Magical Realism', 'Italy', 'Novels', 'Books About Books', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']","['The reader', 'Ludmilla Vipiteno', 'Lotaria Vipiteno', 'Ermes Marana', 'Silas Flannery', 'Irnerio']","Paperback","","260","L&OD Key Porter","10/20/82","10/28/79","['Ars Translationis (2010)', 'Ein Buch für die Stadt (2004)']","74688","['30665', '25049', '12781', '4226', '1967']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312857l/374233._SY475_.jpg","12620","153",""

That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.","English","9780553380163","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'History', 'Astronomy', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Popular Science', 'Space', 'Audiobook']","[]","Paperback","Updated & Expanded 10th Anniversary","212","Bantam Books","09/01/98","04/01/88","['Royal Society Science Book Prize Nominee for General Prize (1989)']","303285","['132545', '111195', '45287', '9312', '4946']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333578746l/3869.jpg","12369","175",2.72

This new translation by his wife and most frequent translator, Marion Wiesel, corrects important details and presents the most accurate rendering in English of Elie Wiesel's testimony to what happened in the camps and of his unforgettable message that this horror must simply never be allowed to happen again.","English","9999999999999","['Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Holocaust', 'Biography', 'School', 'Historical', 'War', 'World War II']","[]","Paperback","","115","Hill & Wang","01/16/06","10/28/56","[]","970183","['522654', '298966', '112425', '24323', '11815']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575073611l/1617.jpg","12362","160",""

"2203.John_Adams","John Adams","","David McCullough","4.06","The enthralling, often surprising story of John Adams, one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence,"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris ""interest"" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.","English","9780743223133","['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Presidents', 'Politics', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir', 'American Revolution', 'Audiobook']","['John Adams', 'Benjamin Franklin', 'John Dickinson', 'Abigail Adams', 'George Washington', 'Thomas Jefferson']","Paperback","","751","Simon & Schuster Paperbacks","05/22/01","05/01/01","['Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography (2002)', 'Ambassador Book Award for Biography (2002)', 'Audie Award for Nonfiction (2002)', 'Puddly Award for Nonfiction (2002)', 'American Revolution Round Table Award (2001)', 'Fraunces Tavern Museum Book Award (2002)']","311423","['142630', '93746', '42213', '15483', '17351']","89","['Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1478144278l/2203._SY475_.jpg","12230","168",6.13

She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s — 1Q84 is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.","English","9780307593313","['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Magical Realism', 'Japan', 'Science Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Dystopia']","['Aomame Masami', 'Tengo Kawana', 'Fuka-Eri', 'Komatsu']","Hardcover","","925","Knopf","10/25/11","05/28/09","['Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Fiction (2011)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (2013)']","201096","['68143', '73925', '40096', '13414', '5518']","91","['Tokyo (Japan)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1483103331l/10357575.jpg","11957","144",7.71

He had decided that after our parents died he just didn't want any more fighting between what was left of us. He was twenty-four, Beth was twenty-three, I was twenty-one, Toph was eight, and all of us were so tried already, from that winter. So when something would come up, any little thing, some bill to pay or decision to make, he would just sigh, his eyes tired, his mouth in a sorry kind of smile. But Beth and I...Jesus, we were fighting with everyone, anyone, each other, with strangers at bars, anywhere -- we were angry people wanting to exact revenge. We came to California and we wanted everything, would take what was ours, anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I, he with his backward hat and long hair, living together in our little house in Berkeley, would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and, we felt, a responsibility to reinvent everything, to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows. It was a hopeless sort of exhilaration, a kind of arrogance born of fatalism, I guess, of the feeling that if you could lose a couple of parents in a month, then basically anything could happen, at any time -- all bullets bear your name, all cars are there to crush you, any balcony could give way; more disaster seemed only logical. And then, as in Dorothy's dream, all these people I grew up with were there, too, some of them orphans also, most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary, that it was time to tear or break down, ruin, remake, take and devour. This was San Francisco, you know, and everyone had some dumb idea -- I mean, wicca? -- and no one there would tell you yours was doomed. Thus the public nudity, and this ridiculous magazine, and the Real World tryout, all this need, most of it disguised by sneering, but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window, I guess, a few years when your muscles are taut, coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy? I mean, when we drive, Toph and I, and we drive past people, standing on top of all these hills, part of me wants to stop the car and turn up the radio and have us all dance in formation, and part of me wants to run them all over.""","English","9780375725784","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Humor', 'Biography Memoir', 'American', 'Unfinished', 'Adult', 'Literary Fiction']","[]","Paperback","","485","Vintage","02/13/01","02/17/00","['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for General Nonfiction (2001)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2000)', 'Borders Original Voices Award for Nonfiction (2000)', 'Puddly Award for Memoir (2001)']","171145","['48127', '56880', '39578', '17413', '9147']","84","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327714834l/4953.jpg","11571","148",2.86

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.In Veronika Decides to Die, Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, Veronika Decides to Die questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.","English","9780061124266","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Philosophy', 'Novels', 'Psychology', 'Romance', 'Drama', 'Mental Health', 'Literature', 'Spirituality']","['Boston ""Mari"" Maribu', 'Athena (Greek goddess)', 'Veronika', 'Eduard', 'Dr. Igor', 'Zedka']","Paperback","","210","Harper Perennial","06/01/06","10/28/98","[]","174383","['47198', '58406', '45767', '16113', '6899']","87","['Ljubljana (Slovenia)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348139939l/1431.jpg","11482","142",2.77

After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, he was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped . . . until Papillon. His flight to freedom remains one of the most incredible feats of human cunning, will, and endurance ever undertaken.Charrière's astonishing autobiography, Papillon, was published in France to instant acclaim in 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape.

She is caught off-guard by a young hunter who invades her most private spaces and confounds her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land that has become her own. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected.Over the course of one humid summer, these characters find their connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with whom they share a place. Prodigal Summer demonstrates a balance of narrative, drama and ideas that is characteristic of Barbara Kingsolver's finest work.","English","9780060959036","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Nature', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Literature', 'Environment', 'Audiobook']","['Deanna Wolfe', 'Eddie Bondo', 'Lusa Maluf Landowski', 'Garnett Walker', 'Nannie Rawley']","Paperback","","444","Harper Perennial","10/16/01","10/17/00","[]","98393","['34457', '37387', '20050', '4871', '1628']","93","['Egg Fork, Zebulon County, Kentucky (United States)', 'Kentucky (United States)', 'Appalachia (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1426308771l/14249.jpg","11284","155",3.67
"3388.Corelli_s_Mandolin","Corelli's Mandolin","","Louis de Bernières","3.98","Captain Corelli’s Mandolin is set in the early days of the second world war, before Benito Mussolini invaded Greece. Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade, life isn’t so bad—at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of “Heil Hitler” with his own “Heil Puccini”, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. British author Louis de Bernières is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts, Señor Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island—the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins—would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Bernières seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. Captain Corelli’s Mandolin works on many levels, as a love story, a war story and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books.","English","9780679763970","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Romance', 'Classics', 'War', 'Historical', 'Greece', 'World War II', 'Novels', 'Literature']","['Pelagia', 'Antonio Corelli', 'Mandras', 'Dr Iannis']","Paperback","","437","Vintage","08/29/95","10/28/94","[""Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best Book Overall (1995)""]","76813","['28106', '27618', '14708', '4435', '1946']","92","['Cephallonia (Greece)', 'Greece']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479680795l/3388._SY475_.jpg","11283","152",3.11

Renée, the concierge, is witness to the lavish but vacuous lives of her numerous employers. Outwardly she conforms to every stereotype of the concierge: fat, cantankerous, addicted to television. Yet, unbeknownst to her employers, Renée is a cultured autodidact who adores art, philosophy, music, and Japanese culture. With humor and intelligence she scrutinizes the lives of the building's tenants, who for their part are barely aware of her existence. Then there's Paloma, a twelve-year-old genius. She is the daughter of a tedious parliamentarian, a talented and startlingly lucid child who has decided to end her life on the sixteenth of June, her thirteenth birthday. Until then she will continue behaving as everyone expects her to behave: a mediocre pre-teen high on adolescent subculture, a good but not an outstanding student, an obedient if obstinate daughter. Paloma and Renée hide both their true talents and their finest qualities from a world they suspect cannot or will not appreciate them. They discover their kindred souls when a wealthy Japanese man named Ozu arrives in the building.

"18334354-quantum-roots","Quantum Roots","","Kyle Keyes","4.35","Federal agents, Alexis Grumman and Jeremy Wade track down a current day vigilante, whose fingerprints match those of a Korean War veteran. Author Kyle Keyes uses characters from two previous novels, to promote a theory that particle energy formats with a quantum root system, that can bypass time and space. Keyes believes that such fiction could turn to fact as we move into the age of quantum mechanics. Adventure fans everywhere should delight in this fast paced action story, that brings yesterday's gun play back to settle cyber-age injustice. Synopsis: Jesse Joe Jacks was born sometime during the snow blizzard of 1923. The Lower Elk County, game warden died from a lightning strike on July 23, 1959, while wearing a sheriff's star. Olan Chapman came to life in August of 1974 and found a computer career with a center city, electronics firm. Chapman drinks heavy and is haunted by flashbacks of an older sister, lost to an unsolved case of gang rape and murder. Jacks loved nature and lived to protect wildlife. He stood tall and fought to uphold justice. Jacks was also a crack shot with a firearm - any firearm. Chapman attends the theatre, plays piano and at one time led a march against the National Rifle Association. Both men have the same fingerprints, much to the chagrin of Lt General Alexis Grumman who heads the federal department for para-normal activities. Working with special agent, Jeremy Wade, Grumman breaks open the case when Chapman's fingerprints also match those of the vigilante.","English","9781478392675","['Drama', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Epic', 'Novels', 'Thriller']","[]","Paperback","","262","CreateSpace","08/28/12","","[]","8811","['4185', '3907', '406', '217', '96']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1376602412l/18334354.jpg","10903","120",12.74
"3478.Message_in_a_Bottle","Message in a Bottle","","Nicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author)","3.96","Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity - takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love.Nicholas Sparks is our very best chronicler of the human heart. His stunning first novel, The Notebook, has been given by friend to friend and lover to lover all over the world as a testament to the timeless power of love. But if we thought he could never again move us so deeply, he now shows us he can-in a story that renews our faith in destiny...in the ability of true lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when... Message In A Bottle Thrown to the waves, and to fate, the bottle could have ended up anywhere. Instead, it is found just three weeks after it begins its journey. Theresa Osborne, divorced and the mother of a twelve-year-old son, picks it up during a seaside vacation from her job as a Boston newspaper columnist. Inside is a letter that opens with: My Dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together... For ""Garrett,"" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love. For those who cherished The Notebook and readers waiting to discover the magic of Nicholas Sparks's storytelling, here is his new, achingly lovely novel of happenstance, desire, and the choices that matter most...","English","9780446676076","['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Love', 'Drama', 'Novels']","['Theresa Osborne', 'Garrett Blake']","Paperback","","342","Warner Books","12/01/99","04/01/88","[]","214941","['81110', '67269', '48646', '13020', '4896']","92","['Wilmington, North Carolina (United States)', 'North Carolina (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1163789140l/3478._SY475_.jpg","10885","157",4.04

"1202.Freakonomics","Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything","Freakonomics","Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner (Goodreads Author)","3.98","Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)","English","9780061234002","['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Audiobook', 'Social Science']","[]","Hardcover","Revised and Expanded Edition (US/CAN)","320","William Morrow","10/17/06","04/12/05","['Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Nonfiction (2006)', 'Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Shortlist (2005)', 'The Quill Award for Business (2005)']","708708","['245341', '272578', '139864', '32567', '18358']","93","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550917827l/1202._SX318_.jpg","10521","140",8.33

She doesn’t believe that the Nazis will invade France…but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne’s home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.Vianne’s sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets Gaëtan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can…completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women’s war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France—a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women.

"3805.The_Corrections","The Corrections","","Jonathan Franzen","3.80","Winner of the National Book Award for FictionNominated for the National Book Critics Circle AwardAn American Library Association Notable BookJonathan Franzen's third novel, The Corrections, is a great work of art and a grandly entertaining overture to our new century: a bold, comic, tragic, deeply moving family drama that stretches from the Midwest at mid-century to Wall Street and Eastern Europe in the age of greed and globalism. Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With The Corrections, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says.Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a ""transgressive"" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on.

In Anthem, Rand examines a frightening future in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. Equality 7-2521 lives in the dark ages of the future where all decisions are made by committee, all people live in collectives, and all traces of individualism have been wiped out. Despite such a restrictive environment, the spark of individual thought and freedom still burns in him--a passion which he has been taught to call sinful. In a purely egalitarian world, Equality 7-2521 dares to stand apart from the herd--to think and choose for himself, to discover electricity, and to love the woman of his choice.

Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener’s hand is severed as “the dome” comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact. No one can fathom what this barrier is, where it came from, and when—or if—it will go away.Dale Barbara, Iraq vet and now a short-order cook, finds himself teamed with a few intrepid citizens—town newspaper owner Julia Shumway, a physician’s assistant at the hospital, a selectwoman, and three brave kids. Against them stands Big Jim Rennie, a politician who will stop at nothing—even murder—to hold the reins of power, and his son, who is keeping a horrible secret in a dark pantry. But their main adversary is the Dome itself. Because time isn’t just short.

"3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma","The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals","","Michael Pollan (Goodreads Author)","4.17","What should we have for dinner? For omnivore's like ourselves, this simple question has always posed a dilemma: When you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer, deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the foods on offer might shorten your life. Today, buffeted by one food fad after another, America is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. The omnivore's dilemma has returned with a vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. What's at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children's health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.The Omnivore's Dilemma is a groundbreaking book in which one of America's most fascinating, original, and elegant writers turns his own omnivorous mind to the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. The question has confronted us since man discovered fire, but, according to Michael Pollan, the bestselling author of The Botany of Desire, how we answer it today, ath the dawn of the twenty-first century, may well determine our very survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food hamburger? Something organic> Or perhaps something we hunt, gather or grow ourselves?To find out, Pollan follows each of the food chains that sustain us--industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves--from the source to a final meal, and in the process develops a definitive account of the American way of eating. His absorbing narrative takes us from Iowa cornfields to food laboratories, from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds, always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. Each time Pollan sits down to a meal, he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed, revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance.The surprising answers Pollan offers to the simple question posed by this book have profound political, economic, psychological, and even mortal implications for all of us. Ultimately, this is a book as much about visionary solutions as it is about problems, and Pollan contends that, when it comes to food, doing the right thing often turns out to be the tastiest thing an eater can do. Beautifully written and thrillingly argued, The Omnivore's Dilemma promises to change the way we think about the politics and pleasure of eating. For anyone who reads it, dinner will never again look, or taste, quite the same.--jacket","English","9781594200823","['Nonfiction', 'Food', 'Science', 'Health', 'History', 'Nutrition', 'Environment', 'Cooking', 'Audiobook', 'Politics']","[]","Hardcover","US / CAN Edition","450","The Penguin Press","10/28/06","","['California Book Award for Nonfiction (Gold) (2006)', 'Orion Book Award Nominee (2007)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (2006)']","182235","['76966', '70543', '26440', '5787', '2499']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393804353l/3109.jpg","10229","134",8.08

There’s Arturo the Aquaboy, who has flippers for limbs and a megalomaniac ambition worthy of Genghis Khan . . . Iphy and Elly, the lissome Siamese twins . . . albino hunchback Oly, and the outwardly normal Chick, whose mysterious gifts make him the family’s most precious—and dangerous—asset.As the Binewskis take their act across the backwaters of the U.S., inspiring fanatical devotion and murderous revulsion; as its members conduct their own Machiavellian version of sibling rivalry, Geek Love throws its sulfurous light on our notions of the freakish and the normal, the beautiful and the ugly, the holy and the obscene.

"816.Cryptonomicon","Cryptonomicon","","Neal Stephenson (Goodreads Author)","4.24","Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods—World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.","English","9999999999999","['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Thriller', 'Historical', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'War', 'Fantasy', 'Novels']","['Douglas MacArthur', 'Enoch Root', 'Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse', 'Robert Shaftoe', 'Earl Comstock', 'Rudolf von Hacklheber', 'Alan Turing']","Mass Market Paperback","","1139","Avon","11/05/02","05/28/99","['Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel (2000)', 'Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (2013)', 'Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel (2000)', 'Arthur C.

It's now available in a paperback digest format certain to bring this tale's magic to an even wider circle of fans.The summer Opal and her father, the preacher, move to Naomi, Florida, Opal goes into the Winn-Dixie supermarket—and comes out with a dog. A big, ugly, suffering dog with a sterling sense of humor. A dog she dubs Winn-Dixie. Because of Winn-Dixie, the preacher tells Opal ten things about her absent mother, one for each year Opal has been alive. Winn-Dixie is better at making friends than anyone Opal has ever known, and together they meet the local librarian, Miss Franny Block, who once fought off a bear with a copy of WAR AND PEACE. They meet Gloria Dump, who is nearly blind but sees with her heart, and Otis, an ex-con who sets the animals in his pet shop loose after hours, then lulls them with his guitar.Opal spends all that sweet summer collecting stories about her new friends and thinking about her mother. But because of Winn-Dixie or perhaps because she has grown, Opal learns to let go, just a little, and that friendship—and forgiveness—can sneak up on you like a sudden summer storm.","English","9780763616052","['Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Young Adult', 'Animals', 'Classics', 'School', 'Dogs', 'Juvenile']","['Winn-Dixie', 'India Opal Buloni', 'Otis', 'Miss Franny Block', 'Gloria Dump', 'The Preacher', 'Amanda Wilkinson']","Paperback","","182","Candlewick Press","08/06/01","03/01/00","['Newbery Medal Nominee (2001)', ""Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Children's Literature (2001)"", 'Josette Frank Award (2001)', 'Mark Twain Award  (2003)', 'Texas Bluebonnet Award (2002)', ""South Carolina Book Award for Children's Book Award (2003)"", 'Charlotte Award (2002)', 'Nene Award (2005)', 'Maryland Black-Eyed Susan Book Award for Grade 4-6 (2002)', ""Massachusetts Children's Book Award (2002)"", 'Keystone to Reading Book Award for Intermediate (2003)', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award (2002)"", 'Sunshine State Young Readers Award for Grades 3-5 (2001)', ""Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Reader's Choice Award for Junior (2003)"", ""Charlie May Simon Children's Book Award (2003)"", ""New Mexico Land of Enchantment Award for Children's (2003)"", 'California Young Readers Medal for Intermediate (2003)', ""Judy Lopez Memorial Award for Children's Literature Nominee (2001)"", 'Chapman Award for Shared Reading Nominee for Fiction (2000)', ""William Allen White Children's Book Award (2003)"", 'Washington State Sasquatch Award (2003)', 'Oklahoma Sequoyah Award for Children (2003)']","206478","['81654', '69472', '42869', '9767', '2716']","94","['Florida (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1456871914l/357664._SX318_.jpg","9964","145",4.08

Asher Lev is an artist who is compulsively driven to render the world he sees and feels even when it leads him to blasphemy. In this stirring and often visionary novel, Chaim Potok traces Asher’s passage between these two identities, the one consecrated to God, the other subject only to the imagination.Asher Lev grows up in a cloistered Hasidic community in postwar Brooklyn, a world suffused by ritual and revolving around a charismatic Rebbe.

"33917.The_Namesake","The Namesake","","Jhumpa Lahiri","4.00","Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies established this young writer as one the most brilliant of her generation. Her stories are one of the very few debut works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New Yorker Debut of the Year award, the PEN/Hemingway Award, and the highest critical praise for its grace, acuity, and compassion in detailing lives transported from India to America.In The Namesake, Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail — the fleeting moment, the turn of phrase — that opens whole worlds of emotion.The Namesake takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves.","English","9780618485222","['Fiction', 'India', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Indian Literature', 'Literature', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']","['Ashoke Ganguli', 'Ashima Ganguli', 'Gogol/Nikhil Ganguli', 'Sonia/Sonali Ganguli', 'Maxine', 'Moushumi Mazoomdar']","Paperback","","291","Mariner Books","09/01/04","10/28/03","['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2004)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2003)']","233553","['75016', '97171', '48996', '10027', '2343']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480106986l/33917._SY475_.jpg","9816","140",3.19

Shot Down and Alive For the first time, the full and complete story of the B-17 Flying Fortress Susan Ruth is shared in unbelievable detail. Author Steve Snyder’s story of his father, Lieutenant Howard Snyder, and the Susan Ruth crew, provides in-depth details about many aspects of World War II few understand or know about including the:• separation for young families as men went off to war;• training before heading to foreign soil;• military combat operations;• underground and resistance and what Lt. Snyder did when he joined it;• German atrocities toward captured crew and civilians;• behind-the-scenes stories of the Belgium civilians who risked all to save American flyers who were in the air one moment, spiraling down in flames the next;• creation and dedication of the monument to the Susan Ruth and its crew located in Macquenoise, Belgium in 1989.Shot Down was created from the vast number of letters and journals of Howard Snyder; diaries of men and women on the ground who rescued, sheltered and hid the crew; and interviews conducted by historians. Centered around the 306th Bomb Group in Thurleigh, England, it is informative, insightful and captivating.For most, 70 years is a long time ago. World War II fades in importance as each year goes by. Shot Down moves history out of the footnotes into reality, keeping the stories of real people alive as they experience being shot down. You are there, almost holding your breath as Lt. Snyder gets his crew out of his B-17 when bailing out over Nazi occupied Europe.","English","9780986076008","['Military Fiction', 'History', 'Adult', 'Aviation', 'Nonfiction', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'True Story', 'War', 'New Adult']","[]","Hardcover","","376","Sea Breeze Publishing LLC","08/15/14","","['Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) for History (U.S.) (Silver) (2015)', 'Next Generation Indie Book Awards for Military (2015)', 'USA Best Book Award (2014)', 'International Book Awards for History: General (2015)', 'Southern California Book Festival (2014)', 'Kindle Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (Finalist) (2015)', 'Foreword INDIES Book of the Year Award Nominee for War & Military Nonfiction (2014)']","11097","['5169', '4763', '692', '340', '133']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416874318l/22881898.jpg","9533","105",13.15

"77295.Gift_from_the_Sea","Gift from the Sea","","Anne Morrow Lindbergh","4.15","In this inimitable, beloved classic—graceful, lucid and lyrical—Anne Morrow Lindbergh shares her meditations on youth and age; love and marriage; peace, solitude and contentment as she set them down during a brief vacation by the sea. Drawing inspiration from the shells on the shore, Lindbergh’s musings on the shape of a woman’s life bring new understanding to both men and women at any stage of life. A mother of five, an acclaimed writer and a pioneering aviator, Lindbergh casts an unsentimental eye on the trappings of modernity that threaten to overwhelm us: the time-saving gadgets that complicate rather than simplify, the multiple commitments that take us from our families. And by recording her thoughts during a brief escape from everyday demands, she helps readers find a space for contemplation and creativity within their own lives.With great wisdom and insight Lindbergh describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of life as it is lived in an enduring and evolving partnership. A groundbreaking, best-selling work when it was originally published in 1955, Gift from the Sea continues to be discovered by new generations of readers. With a new introduction by Lindbergh’s daughter Reeve, this fiftieth-anniversary edition will give those who are revisiting the book and those who are coming upon it for the first time fresh insight into the life of this remarkable woman.The sea and the beach are elements that have been woven throughout Anne Morrow Lindbergh’s life. She spent her childhood summers with her family on a Maine island. After her marriage to Charles Lindbergh in 1929, she accompanied him on his survey flights around the North Atlantic to launch the first transoceanic airlines. The Lindberghs eventually established a permanent home on the Connecticut coast, where they lived quietly, wrote books and raised their family.After the children left home for lives of their own, the Lindberghs traveled extensively to Africa and the Pacific for environmental research.","English","9780394724553","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Classics', 'Inspirational', 'Spirituality', 'Self Help', 'Essays', 'Biography', 'Philosophy', 'Biography Memoir']","[]","Paperback","","130","Vintage","01/30/91","10/28/55","['National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (1956)']","42686","['19479', '13437', '7192', '1924', '654']","94","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328312670l/77295.jpg","9391","134",4.85
"36236123-survivor","Survivor","","Chuck Palahniuk (Goodreads Author)","3.91","From the author of the underground sensation Fight Club comes this wickedly incisive second novel, a mesmerizing, unnerving, and hilarious vision of cult and post-cult life.Tender Branson—last surviving member of the so-called Creedish Death Cult—is dictating his life story into the flight recorder of Flight 2039, cruising on autopilot at 39,000 feet somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. He is all alone in the airplane, which will crash shortly into the vast Australian outback. Before it does, he will unfold the tale of his journey from an obedient Creedish child and humble domestic servant to an ultra-buffed, steroid- and collagen-packed media messiah, author of a best-selling autobiography, Saved from Salvation, and the even better selling Book of Very Common Prayer (The Prayer to Delay Orgasm, The Prayer to Prevent Hair Loss, The Prayer to Silence Car Alarms). He'll reveal the truth of his tortured romance with the elusive and prescient Fertility Hollis, share his insight that ""the only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage,"" and deny responsibility for the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill, a 20,000-acre repository for the nation's outdated pornography. Among other matters both bizarre and trenchant.Not since Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night and Jerzy Kosinski's Being There has there been as dark and telling a satire on the wages of fame and the bedrock lunacy of the modern world. Unpredictable, compelling, and unforgettable, Survivor is Chuck Palahniuk at his deadpan peak; and it cements his place as one of the most original writers in fiction today.","","9780393355932","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Thriller', 'Novels', 'Humor', 'Dark', 'Literature', 'American', 'Audiobook', 'Adult']","['Tender Branson', 'Fertility Hollis', 'The Agent', 'The Caseworker', 'Primus']","Paperback","","304","W.

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.","English","9780062255655","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Magical Realism', 'Audiobook', 'Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult Fiction', 'Paranormal']","['Lettie Hempstock', 'Ursula Monkton', 'The Nameless Boy', 'Ginnie Hempstock', 'Old Mrs. Hempstock']","Hardcover","First Edition","181","William Morrow Books","06/18/13","","['Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (2013)', 'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2014)', 'World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (2014)', 'Mythopoeic Fantasy Award Nominee for Adult Literature (2014)', 'Specsavers National Book Award for Book of the Year (2013)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Fantasy (2013 and Nominee for Best of the Best  (2018)']","480713","['173646', '180366', '91065', '25455', '10181']","93","['Sussex, England (United Kingdom)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1497098563l/15783514._SY475_.jpg","9314","111",4.78

"18300212-the-trigger","The Trigger: Hunting the Assassin Who Brought the World to War","","Tim Butcher (Goodreads Author)","4.11","On a summer morning in Sarajevo a hundred years ago, a teenage assassin named Gavrilo Princip fired not just the opening shots of the First World War but the starting gun for modern history, when he killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Yet the events Princip triggered were so monumental that his own story has been largely overlooked, his role garbled and motivations misrepresented.The Trigger puts this right, filling out as never before a figure who changed our world and whose legacy still has an impact on all of us today. Born a penniless backwoodsman, Princip’s life changed when he trekked through Bosnia and Serbia to attend school. As he ventured across fault lines of faith, nationalism and empire, so tightly clustered in the Balkans, radicalisation slowly transformed him from a frail farm boy into history’s most influential assassin.By retracing Princip’s journey from his highland birthplace, through the mythical valleys of Bosnia to the fortress city of Belgrade and ultimately Sarajevo, Tim Butcher illuminates our understanding both of Princip and the places that shaped him. Tim uncovers details about Princip that have eluded historians for a century and draws on his own experience, as a war reporter in the Balkans in the 1990s, to face down ghosts of conflicts past and present.The Trigger is a rich and timely work that brings to life both the moment the world first went to war and an extraordinary region with a potent hold over history.","English","9780701187934","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War I', 'War', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'European History', '20th Century', 'Biography Memoir']","['Gavrilo Princip']","Hardcover","","352","Chatto & Windus","05/01/14","","[]","1257","['496', '482', '217', '44', '18']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388535774l/18300212.jpg","9160","94",4.97
"36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People","The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change","","Stephen R. Covey, Jim Collins (Foreward, Contributor)","4.12","When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life","English","9780743269513","['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Leadership', 'Productivity', 'Management', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy']","[]","Paperback","Anniversary Edition","372","Free Press","11/09/04","08/15/89","[]","524128","['236705', '164544', '85282', '24020', '13577']","93","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421842784l/36072.jpg","9152","133",5.0
"2595138-the-gargoyle","The Gargoyle","","Andrew Davidson (Goodreads Author)","3.97","An extraordinary debut novel of love that survives the fires of hell and transcends the boundaries of time.The narrator of The Gargoyle is a very contemporary cynic, physically beautiful and sexually adept, who dwells in the moral vacuum that is modern life. As the book opens, he is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and suffers horrible burns over much of his body. As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide—for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul. A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life—and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete—and her time on earth will be finished. Already an international literary sensation, the Gargoyle is an Inferno for our time. It will have you believing in the impossible.","English","9780385524940","['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Gothic', 'Paranormal', 'Adult Fiction']","['Marianne Engel']","Paperback","","468","Doubleday","01/01/08","","['Sunburst Award for Canadian Novel (2009)', 'LovelyBooks Leserpreis Nominee for Allgemeine Literatur (2009)']","43480","['16313', '14786', '8244', '2848', '1289']","90","['North America', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'England', 'Italy', 'Iceland (country)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1368598513l/2595138.jpg","9130","111",3.25

It is also the introduction of a bold and talented literary voice. Before considering reading this book, please see the BookBrowse note on the book jacket/review page.BookBrowse Note: January 9th 2006: An article in the Smoking Gun claimed that James Frey (author of A Million Little Pieces and My Friend Leonard) fabricated key parts of his books. They cited police records, court documents and interviews with law enforcement agents which belie a number of Frey's claims regarding criminal charges against him, jail terms and his fugitive status.In an interview with the Smoking Gun, Frey admitted that he had 'embellished central details' in A Million Little Pieces and backtracked on claims he made in the book.January 26th 2006. Frey's publisher stated that while it initially stood by him, after further questioning of the author, the house has ""sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished.""

Crescere in una periferia come questa non è certo il modo migliore per dare alla propria vita grandi prospettive. Ma è qui che Sean, Jimmy e Dave sono nati, e la loro esistenza sarebbe stata uguale a quella di tanti altri se non fosse arrivata quella dannata mattina. La mattina in cui Dave, con i suoi occhi spenti pieni di lacrime è salito sul sedile posteriore di quella macchina. Ed è scomparso per quattro, terribili giorni. Venticinque anni dopo, la violenza torna a segnare la vita di Dave. Questa volta però gli sguardi che si posano su di lui non sono compassionevoli, ma carichi d'odio e disprezzo. Reazione più che naturale di fronte all'omicidio di una ragazza di diciannove anni di cui Dave è accusato.

"7445.The_Glass_Castle","The Glass Castle","","Jeannette Walls","4.28","A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.","English","9780743247542","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'School']","['Jeannette Walls', 'Rex Walls', 'Rose Mary Walls', 'Maureen Walls', 'Brian Walls', 'Lori Walls']","Paperback","","288","Scribner","January 17th 2006","03/28/05","['ALA Alex Award (2006)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2008)']","903463","['445108', '310999', '110694', '25026', '11636']","96","['New York City, New York (United States)', 'West Virginia (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523542886l/7445._SY475_.jpg","8539","109",2.87

No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children.Now, for the first time, this astonishing novel is made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and newly added second and third appendices.The story remains unchanged, focusing on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.","English","9780385603102","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Literature', 'Paranormal']","['Zampanò', 'Will Navidson', 'Karen Green', 'Johnny Truant']","Paperback","","705","Random House","March 7th 2000","","['Bram Stoker Award Nominee for Best First Novel (2000)', 'Locus Award Nominee for Best First Novel (2001)', 'New York Public Library Young Lions Fiction Award (2001)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2000)', 'James Tait Black Memorial Prize Nominee for Fiction (2000)', 'International Horror Guild Award Nominee for Best First Novel (2000)', 'Premio Ignotus Nominee for Mejor novela extranjera (Best Foreign Novel) (2014)']","131060","['61156', '36282', '19289', '8446', '5887']","89","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403889034l/24800.jpg","8420","94",22.02

All across America, readers are talking about Stieg Larsson’s best-selling novels, set in Sweden and featuring Lisbeth Salander—“one of the most original and memorable heroines to surface in a recent thriller” (The New York Times). The trilogy is an international sensation that will grab you and keep you “reading with eyes wide open” (San Francisco Chronicle). “[It] is intricately plotted, lavishly detailed but written with a breakneck pace and verve” (The Independent, U.K.), but “be warned: the trilogy is seriously addictive.” (The Guardian, U.K.).“Believe the hype . . .

And so will you.”—USA Today“Larsson has bottled lightning.”—Los Angeles Times The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared without a trace more than forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to try to discover what happened to her. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist recently sidelined by a libel conviction, to investigate. Blomkvist is aided by the pierced and tattooed computer prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption on their way to discovering the truth of Harriet Vanger’s fate. The Girl Who Played with Fire Mikael Blomkvist, now the crusading publisher of the magazine Millennium, has decided to run a story that will expose an extensive sex trafficking operation. On the eve of its publication, the two reporters responsible for the article are murdered, and the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to his friend Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist, convinced of Salander’s innocence, plunges into an investigation of the murders. Meanwhile, Salander herself is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse, which forces her to face her dark past. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest Lisbeth Salander lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. She’s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she’ll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. On her own, she will plot revenge—against the man who tried to kill her, and against the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life. “Unique and fascinating . . .

For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm—and into Edgar's mother's affections. Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires—spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward. David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes—the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain—create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic.","English","9780061374227","['Fiction', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Coming Of Age', 'Book Club', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'Novels']","['Edgar Sawtelle, Gar Sawtelle, Trudy Sawtelle, Claude Sawtelle, John Sawtelle, Mary Sawtelle', 'Almondine, Essay']","Hardcover","","566","Ecco","June 1st 2008","","['John Sargent, Sr. First Novel Prize (2008)', 'Colorado Book Award for Literary Fiction (2009)', 'Sakura Medal Nominee for High School Book (2010)', 'Indies Choice Book Award for Best Author Discovery (2009)', 'Puddly Award for Fiction (2009)', 'The Center for Fiction First Novel Prize Nominee (2008)']","90950","['22743', '31035', '22160', '10262', '4750']","83","['Mellen (United States)', 'Wisconsin (United States)', 'Pusan (Korea, Republic of)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1310466361l/2731276.jpg","8234","111",3.36

Poetic and nostalgic, it is an elegy to a lost world.Richard Dafydd Vivian Llewellyn Lloyd (1906-1983), better known by his pen name Richard Llewellyn, claimed to have been born in St David's, Pembrokeshire, Wales; after his death he was discovered to have been born of Welsh parents in Hendon, Middlesex. His famous first novel How Green Was My Valley (1939) was begun in St David's from a draft he had written in India, and was later adapted into an Oscar-winning film by director John Ford. None But the Lonely Heart, his second novel, was published in 1943, and subsequently made into a film starring Cary Grant and Ethel Barrymore. As well as novels including Green, Green My Valley Now (1975) and I Stand on a Quiet Shore (1982), Llewellyn wrote two highly successful plays, Poison Pen and NooseIf you enjoyed How Green Was My Valley, you might like Barry Hines' A Kestrel for a Knave, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.'Vivid, eloquent, poetical, glowing with an inner flame of emotion'The Times Literary Supplement","English","9999999999999","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Coming Of Age', 'Novels', 'Modern Classics', '20th Century']","['Huw Morgan']","Paperback","","448","Penguin Classics","June 28th 2001","10/28/39","['National Book Award for Fiction (1940)']","14656","['6518', '5113', '2328', '517', '180']","95","['Wales']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440708862l/40496._SY475_.jpg","8211","119",""

How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.","English","9999999999999","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'Historical', 'Psychology', 'Evolution']","[]","Paperback","","498","Harvill Secker","2014","01/01/11","['Royal Society of Biology General Book Prize Nominee (2015)', 'J.

"54539.Silas_Marner","Silas Marner","","George Eliot","3.65","George Eliot's tale of a solitary miser gradually redeemed by the joy of fatherhood, Silas Marner is edited with an introduction and notes by David Carroll in Penguin Classics.Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of Eppie, the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.This text uses the Cabinet edition, revised by George Eliot in 1878. David Carroll's introduction is complemented by the original Penguin Classics edition introduction by Q.D. Leavis.Mary Ann Evans (1819-80) began her literary career as a translator, and later editor, of the Westminster Review. In 1857, she published Scenes of Clerical Life, the first of eight novels she would publish under the name of 'George Eliot', including The Mill on the Floss, Middlemarch, and Daniel Deronda.If you enjoyed Silas Marner, you might like Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, also available in Penguin Classics.'I think Silas Marner holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

Modern editions use a later revised version printed in 1817 and featuring a gloss. Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it was a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.It relates the events experienced by a mariner who has returned from a long sea voyage. The Mariner stops a man on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The Wedding-Guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience, fear, and fascination as the Mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: for example, the use of narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, or the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood each different part of the poem.","English","9780486223056","['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'School', '18th Century', 'British Literature', 'Gothic', 'Romanticism']","['Ancient Mariner', 'Wedding Guest']","Paperback","","77","Dover Publications","June 1st 1970","10/28/98","['награда ""Пловдив"" for Художествен превод (2011)']","54104","['19409', '17967', '12238', '3445', '1045']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436976206l/732562._SX318_.jpg","7584","123",2.83

But there's no room for him in the 1980s. Thatcher's government is destroying working-class communities across Britain, and the post-war certainties of full employment, educational opportunity and a welfare state are gone. When his family starts to fracture, Mark's life swings out of control and he succumbs to the defeatism which has taken hold in Edinburgh's grimmer areas. The way out is heroin.It's no better for his friends. Spud Murphy is paid off from his job, Tommy Lawrence feels himself being sucked into a life of petty crime and violence - the worlds of the thieving Matty Connell and psychotic Franco Begbie. Only Sick Boy, the supreme manipulator of the opposite sex, seems to ride the current, scamming and hustling his way through it all.Skagboys charts their journey from likely lads to young men addicted to the heroin which has flooded their disintegrating community.

Unprepared for the consequences of their attraction, at first each feigns indifference. But during the restless summer weeks that follow, unrelenting buried currents of obsession and fear, fascination and desire, intensify their passion as they test the charged ground between them. What grows from the depths of their spirits is a romance of scarcely six weeks' duration and an experience that marks them for a lifetime. For what the two discover on the Riviera and during a sultry evening in Rome is the one thing both already fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy. The psychological maneuvers that accompany attraction have seldom been more shrewdly captured than in André Aciman's frank, unsentimental, heartrending elegy to human passion. Call Me by Your Name is clear-eyed, bare-knuckled, and ultimately unforgettable.","English","9781786495259","['Fiction', 'Romance', 'LGBT', 'Contemporary', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Gay', 'Coming Of Age', 'M M Romance']","['Elio', 'Oliver']","Paperback","","248","Atlantic Books","September 21st 2017","01/23/07","[]","210409","['107822', '61594', '27353', '9154', '4486']","94","['Italy', 'Italian Riviera (Italy)', 'Liguria (Italy)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1519203520l/36336078._SY475_.jpg","7325","76",4.2

But when Sophie attracts too much human attention for a prom-night spell gone horribly wrong, it's her dad who decides her punishment: exile to Hex Hall, an isolated reform school for wayward Prodigium, a.k.a. witches, faeries, and shapeshifters. By the end of her first day among fellow freak-teens, Sophie has quite a scorecard: three powerful enemies who look like supermodels, a futile crush on a gorgeous warlock, a creepy tag-along ghost, and a new roommate who happens to be the most hated person and only vampire student on campus. Worse, Sophie soon learns that a mysterious predator has been attacking students, and her only friend is the number-one suspect. As a series of blood-curdling mysteries starts to converge, Sophie prepares for the biggest threat of all: an ancient secret society determined to destroy all Prodigium, especially her.","English","9781423121305","['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Vampires', 'Witches', 'Supernatural', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Demons']","['Jenna', 'Sophia Mercer', 'Archer Cross', 'Elodie', 'Mrs. Casnoff']","Hardcover","","323","Hyperion Book CH","March 2nd 2010","","[]","132490","['46992', '45004', '28830', '7882', '3782']","91","['Georgia (United States)', 'Vermont (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1368393885l/5287473.jpg","7322","96",3.17

Overwhelmed, overwrought, and overweight, an everyday housewife walks into the Sonoran Desert to die.But there's more to a desert than sand or death. There's thorns, venom, claws, heat, thirst, other people—and unexpected adventure.As she says, ""It's because your gums are receding and your hair is thinning and your neckline is sagging. It's because all you ever had was your youth, and you spent that so long ago now it's hard to remember what you bought with it. Mrs. Warner shuddered in her loosening skin, was almost running now. It's because you're scared. Lately you're so scared and so aimless and so useless you sleep half the day and panic half the night. In between, you watch TV to ward off the evil of watching yourself. So—if not death, then what?""When she tripped over a rock—and in tripping, plunged over the edge of a cliff—Mrs. Warner had forgotten the desert, the cacti, the heat, the hunger, the thirst. All that was left was an ever increasing panic and an ever deepening desperation. And then there was the shock of falling and the screaming inside: Here we go, here we go—but don't hurt, don't hurt.

"5139.The_Devil_Wears_Prada","The Devil Wears Prada","The Devil Wears Prada #1","Lauren Weisberger","3.75","A delightfully dishy novel about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses. Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job “a million girls would die for.” Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of ""Runway ""magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts ""Prada! Armani! Versace!"" at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.","English","9780307275554","['Chick Lit', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Adult', 'Humor', 'Adult Fiction', 'Fashion', 'Novels', 'Realistic Fiction']","['Andrea Sachs', 'Miranda Priestly', 'Alexander Fineman', 'Emily', 'Lily Goodwin']","Paperback","","432","Anchor Books","May 30th 2006","04/15/03","[]","786346","['223039', '261781', '211944', '63067', '26515']","89","['New York City, New York (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388179604l/5139.jpg","6913","104",2.94

Truly an amazement—and a great gift for its readers.When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity. Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.","English","9780385539258","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Literature']","['Jude St. Francis', 'Willem Ragnarsson', 'Malcom Irvine', 'Jean-Baptiste (JB) Marion', 'Harold Stein', 'Julia Altman', 'Andy Contractor', 'Richard Goldfarb', 'Ana']","Hardcover","First Edition","720","Doubleday","March 10th 2015","","['Booker Prize Nominee (2015)', ""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee (2016)"", 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (Shortlist) (2016)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2015)', 'Kirkus Prize for Fiction (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2015)', 'Waterstones Book of the Year Nominee (2015)', 'Jarl Hellemann -palkinto (2017)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (2017)']","211560","['122769', '52252', '21553', '9093', '5893']","93","['New York City, New York (United States)', 'SoHo, New York City, New York (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446469353l/22822858._SY475_.jpg","6875","72",18.32

"27822.Eugene_Onegin","Eugene Onegin","","Alexander Pushkin, James E. Falen (Translator)","4.10","Eugene Onegin is the master work of the poet whom Russians regard as the fountainhead of their literature. Set in imperial Russia during the 1820s, Pushkin's novel in verse follows the emotions and destiny of three men - Onegin the bored fop, Lensky the minor elegiast, and a stylized Pushkin himself - and the fates and affections of three women - Tatyana the provincial beauty, her sister Olga, and Pushkin's mercurial Muse. Engaging, full of suspense, and varied in tone, it also portrays a large cast of other characters and offers the reader many literary, philosophical, and autobiographical digressions, often in a highly satirical vein. Eugene Onegin was Pushkin's own favourite work, and it shows him attempting to transform himself from romantic poet into realistic novelist. This new translation seeks to retain both the literal sense and the poetic music of the original, and capture the poem's spontaneity and wit. The introduction examines several ways of reading the novel, and the text is richly annotated.","English","9780192838995","['Classics', 'Poetry', 'Russia', 'Fiction', 'Russian Literature', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'School']","['Eugene Onegin', 'Vladimir Lensky', 'Tatyana Larina', 'Olga Larina', 'Zaretsky', 'Larina']","Paperback","Oxford World's Classics","240","Oxford University Press","October 22nd 1998","10/28/33","[]","51641","['22493', '16055', '9576', '2627', '890']","93","['St. Petersburg, Russia', 'Russia', 'Moscow (Russian Federation)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388373138l/27822.jpg","6474","90",3.91

A retired English professor who began writing fiction at the age of 70, Maclean produced what is now recognized as one of the classic American stories of the twentieth century. Originally published in 1976, A River Runs through It and Other Stories now celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary, marked by this new edition that includes a foreword by Annie Proulx.Maclean grew up in the western Rocky Mountains in the first decades of the twentieth century. As a young man he worked many summers in logging camps and for the United States Forest Service. The two novellas and short story in this collection are based on his own experiences—the experiences of a young man who found that life was only a step from art in its structures and beauty. The beauty he found was in reality, and so he leaves a careful record of what it was like to work in the woods when it was still a world of horse and hand and foot, without power saws, ""cats,"" or four-wheel drives. Populated with drunks, loggers, card sharks, and whores, and set in the small towns and surrounding trout streams and mountains of western Montana, the stories concern themselves with the complexities of fly fishing, logging, fighting forest fires, playing cribbage, and being a husband, a son, and a father.","English","9780226500669","['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Nature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Westerns', 'Novels', 'American']","[]","Paperback","25th Anniversary Edition","217","University of Chicago Press","October 1st 2001","10/28/76","[]","22019","['9795', '7675', '3503', '798', '248']","95","['Missoula, Montana (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924914l/30043.jpg","6320","89",2.41

The short summer gives her little time to look, and when she finds a sheltered valley with a herd of hardy steppe horses, she decides to stay and prepare for the long glacial winter ahead. Living with the Clan has taught Ayla many skills but not real hunting. She finally knows she can survive when she traps a horse, which gives her meat and a warm pelt for the winter, but fate has bestowed a greater gift, an orphaned foal with whom she develops a unique kinship. One winter extends to more; she discovers a way to make fire more quickly and a wounded cave lion cub joins her unusual family, but her beloved animals don't fulfill her restless need for human companionship. Then she hears the sound of a man screaming in pain. She saves tall, handsome Jondalar, who brings her a language to speak and an awakening of love and desire, but Ayla is torn between her fear of leaving her valley and her hope of living with her own kind.","English","9780553381665","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Prehistoric', 'Adventure', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction']","['Ayla', 'Jondalar']","Paperback","","544","Bantam","June 25th 2002","10/28/82","[]","77324","['27609', '27863', '16562', '4071', '1219']","93","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1324059760l/40493.jpg","6305","97",5.3

Relive the adventure from the beginning with this boxed set of the first three books with glorious new cover art by John Rocco. The Lightning Thief Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. When his mom tells him the truth about where he came from, she takes him to the one place he'll be safe—Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island). There, Percy learns that the father he never knew is actually Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon Percy finds himself caught up in a mystery that could lead to disastrous consequences. Together with his friends—a satyr and another the demigod daughter of Athena—Percy sets out on a quest to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods. The Sea of Monsters After a summer spent trying to prevent a catastrophic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly calm. But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: the magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters—the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millennia—only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new name: the Bermuda Triangle. Now Percy and his friends must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclops by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. But first, Percy will learn a stunning new secret about his family—one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke… The Titan's Curse When Percy Jackson receives a distress call from his friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle. He knows he'll need his powerful demigod allies, Annabeth and Thalia, at his side; his trusty bronze sword Riptide; and…a ride from his mom. The demigods race to the rescue, to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two new powerful half-bloods whose parentage is unknown. But that's not all that awaits them. The Titan lord, Kronos, has set up his most devious trap yet, and the young heroes have unwittingly fallen prey. Hilarious and action-packed, this third adventure in the series finds Percy faced with his most dangerous challenge so far: the chilling prophecy of the Titan's curse.","English","9781423113492","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Mythology', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Greek Mythology', 'Magic', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade']","[]","Board Book","Boxed Set","1032","Hyperion Books for Children","September 16th 2008","","[]","39475","['27941', '7921', '2774', '500', '339']","98","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388181482l/3165162.jpg","6214","85",5.26

Now, at last, the most important tales of this distinctive American genious are gathered in one volume by National Book Award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates.Combining the nineteenth-century gothic sesibility of Edgar Allan Poe with a daring internal vision, Lovecraft's tales foretold a psychically troubled century to come.  Set in a meticulously described, historically grounded New England landscape, his harrowing stories explore the collapse of sanity beneath the weight of chaotic events.  Lovecraft's universe is a frightening shadow world where reality and nightmare intertwine, and redemption can come only from below.  In her preceptive and penetrating introduction, Oates, herself a virtuoso of the Gothic style, explains how Lovecraft's singular talents fused the supernatural and mundane into a terrifying complex, exquisitely realized vision.","English","9780060957902","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Gothic', 'Literature', 'Weird Fiction', 'Lovecraftian']","[]","Paperback","","352","Ecco","September 19th 2000","10/28/35","[]","8852","['4135', '3097', '1309', '241', '70']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1168709833l/36314._SX318_.jpg","6207","94",5.01

"6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks","The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks","","Rebecca Skloot (Goodreads Author)","4.07","Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.","English","9781400052172","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Biography', 'Medicine', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Medical', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical']","['Henrietta Lacks']","Hardcover","","370","Crown Publishing Group","February 2nd 2010","","['Ambassador Book Award for American Studies (2011)', 'Audie Award for Nonfiction (2011)', 'Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Nonfiction (2010)', 'Wellcome Book Prize (2010)', 'Puddly Award for Nonfiction (2011)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for  Nonfiction and Debut Author and Nominee for Favorite Book (2010)', 'AAAS/Subaru SB&F Prize for Excellence in Science Books for Young Adult Science Book (2011)']","587187","['238511', '210677', '94444', '25799', '17756']","93","['Baltimore, Maryland (United States)', 'Clover, Virginia (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327878144l/6493208.jpg","6067","84",5.28

Ella Rubenstein is forty years old and unhappily married when she takes a job as a reader for a literary agent. Her first assignment is to read and report on Sweet Blasphemy, a novel written by a man named Aziz Zahara. Ella is mesmerized by his tale of Shams's search for Rumi and the dervish's role in transforming the successful but unhappy cleric into a committed mystic, passionate poet, and advocate of love. She is also taken with Shams's lessons, or rules, that offer insight into an ancient philosophy based on the unity of all people and religions, and the presence of love in each and every one of us. As she reads on, she realizes that Rumi's story mir­rors her own and that Zahara—like Shams—has come to set her free.","English","9999999999999","['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'Romance', 'Philosophy', 'Turkish Literature', 'Spirituality', 'Turkish', 'Literature', 'Religion']","['Rumi', 'Shams-i Tabrizi']","Hardcover","","354","Viking","February 18th 2010","10/28/09","['International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2011)', 'Muhammad Hasan Askari Award for Urdu Translation (2017)']","128118","['61230', '37866', '18277', '6678', '4067']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442161289l/6642715._SY475_.jpg","6011","65",""

It is said that angels found the land and saw it was good... and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. Phèdre nó Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye. Sold into indentured servitude as a child, her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with very a special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel's Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one.Phèdre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is courtesan, Phèdre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundations of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further. And in the doing, it will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Phèdre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear.

Forster (Goodreads Author)","4.31","This book developed from a journal of my thoughts and feelings recorded in response to the shock of my wife’s diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer in December 2015. Initially, I kept it as a personal diary of things that I believed were important at the time, including the poems and prose I wrote which sprang organically from the events as they unfolded. Whilst these few short months were extremely challenging, at times shocking and ultimately tragic, they were also a time of great love. Hopefully, I have captured some of those few moments of pure happiness, humour and joy which I believe will not only help other people touched by cancer but will show sufferers and their families that there is no right or wrong way to behave, just as long as you continue to show how much you care and as much as possible, be there for each other.","English","B082ZXXN48","['Drama', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Novels']","[]","Kindle Edition","","469","","December 22nd 2019","","[]","6629","['3055', '2951', '318', '200', '105']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577193942l/49823970._SY475_.jpg","5996","67",""

Zorba, a Greek working man, is a larger-than-life character, energetic and unpredictable. He accompanies the unnamed narrator to Crete to work in the narrator’s lignite mine, and the pair develops a singular relationship. The two men couldn’t be further apart: The narrator is cerebral, modest, and reserved; Zorba is unfettered, spirited, and beyond the reins of civility. Over the course of their journey, he becomes the narrator’s greatest friend and inspiration and helps him to appreciate the joy of living.Zorba has been acclaimed as one of the most remarkable figures in literature; he is a character in the great tradition of Sinbad the Sailor, Falstaff, and Sancho Panza. He responds to all that life offers him with passion, whether he’s supervising laborers at a mine, confronting mad monks in a mountain monastery, embellishing the tales of his past adventures, or making love. Zorba the Greek explores the beauty and pain of existence, inviting readers to reevaluate the most important aspects of their lives and live to the fullest.","English","9780571203130","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Greece', 'Historical Fiction', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Unfinished']","['unnamed narrator', 'Alexis Zorba', 'Widow', 'Madame Hortense', 'Mimithos']","Paperback","","335","Faber and Faber","April 3rd 2000","10/28/46","['Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger for Roman (1954)']","37504","['15960', '12206', '6286', '2088', '964']","92","['Crete (Greece)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542885673l/53639._SY475_.jpg","5950","75",3.11

"28009303-dodging-satan","Dodging Satan: My Irish/Italian, Sometimes Awesome, But Mostly Creepy, Childhood","","Kathleen Zamboni McCormick (Goodreads Author)","4.31","In this humorous coming-of-age story, Bridget Flagherty, a student at St. Michael’s Catholic school outside Boston in the 60s and 70s, takes refuge in her wacky misunderstandings of Bible Stories and Catholic beliefs to avoid the problems of her Irish/Italian family life. Her musings on sadistic nuns, domestic violence, emerging sexuality, and God the Father’s romantic life will delight readers. Bridget creates glorious supernatural worlds—with exorcisms, bird relics, Virgin Martyrs, time travel, Biblical plagues, even the ‘holy’ in holy water—to cope with a family where leather handbags and even garlic can cause explosions. An avid Bible reader who innocently believes everything the nuns tell her, Bridget’s saints, martyrs, and boney Christs become alive and audible within her. While the nuns chide her sinful ‘mathematical pride’ and slow eating habits, God answers her prayers instantly by day, but the devil visits nightly in the dark. Scenes run the gamut from laugh-out-loud Catholic brainwashing of children, to heart-wrenching abuse, to riveting teenage excursions toward sex. Young Bridget tries to make sense of a world of raging men and domestically subjugated women and carve a future for herself, wrestling with how God and men treat women. Her Italian female relatives—glamorous Santa Anna, black-and-blue Aunt Maria, sophisticated Eleanor with a New York ‘Fellini pageboy’—offer sensual alternatives to the repression of her immediate family. She prays fervently that “despite God’s bizarre treatment of married women... some [girls] might still discover ways to have a great time without being a nun.” Dodging Satan is the flip-side of l'Histoire d'une Âme by Saint Thérèse of Lisieux authored by a twentieth century American girl chomping on a blue-gum cigar while she talks to a confidant about God and sex.","English","B0187OW2OM","['Drama', 'Contemporary', 'Book Club', 'Epic', 'Fiction', 'Novels']","[]","Kindle Edition","","191","Sand Hill Review Press","November 18th 2015","","['Independent Press Award for Humor & Wit (2020)', 'Rubery Book Award Shortlisted (2020)']","4525","['2036', '2084', '225', '125', '55']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448816156l/28009303._SY475_.jpg","5879","65",""

Instead of describing their outward expressions of grief, Virginia Woolf draws her characters from the inside, revealing them through their thoughts and interior soliloquies. As their understanding of nature’s trials grows, the chorus of narrative voices blends together in miraculous harmony, remarking not only on the inevitable death of individuals but on the eternal connection of everyone.

Their father, Saboor, is constantly in search of work and they struggle together through poverty and brutal winters. To Abdullah, Pari - as beautiful and sweet-natured as the fairy for which she was named - is everything. More like a parent than a brother, Abdullah will do anything for her, even trading his only pair of shoes for a feather for her treasured collection.

A self-declared ""light-skinned"" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician and son, explores his mother's past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother. The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in ""orchestrated chaos"" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. ""Mommy,"" a fiercely protective woman with ""dark eyes full of pep and fire,"" herded her brood to Manhattan's free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion--and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain. In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother's footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents' loveless marriage; her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned. At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all-black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. ""God is the color of water,"" Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life's blessings and life's values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth's determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college--and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University. Interspersed throughout his mother's compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self-realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.","English","9781573225786","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'African American', 'Race', 'Biography Memoir', 'School', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Classics']","[]","Paperback","","291","Riverhead Books","January 14th 2004","01/23/96","['Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (1997)']","103804","['40430', '39665', '18339', '3769', '1601']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401311300l/29209.jpg","5827","81",1.62

Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever. The Rescue When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love. In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.","English","9780446696128","['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Love', 'Drama', 'Love Story']","['Denise Holton', 'Taylor McAden']","Paperback","","352","Grand Central Publishing","April 1st 2005","10/28/00","[]","167967","['69955', '56220', '33464', '6460', '1868']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385055753l/3462.jpg","5753","79",3.35

"11602.Hearts_in_Atlantis","Hearts in Atlantis","","Stephen King (Goodreads Author)","3.83","Five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.Stephen King, whose first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, is the first hugely popular writer of the TV generation. Images from that war -- and the protests against it -- had flooded America's living rooms for a decade. Hearts in Atlantis, King's newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War. In Part One, ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror. In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast. In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow -- and as haunted -- as their own lives. And in ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,"" this remarkable book's denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart's desire may await him. Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of heart, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.","English","9780340818671","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Short Stories', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Supernatural', 'Mystery', 'War', 'Historical Fiction']","['The Crimson King', 'American Law Enforcement', 'Ted Brautigan', 'Bobby Garfield', 'Liz Garfield', 'Carol Gerber', 'John Sullivan', 'Peter Riley', 'Willie Shearman', 'Ronnie Malenfant']","Paperback","Film tie-in","640","New English Library","2001","09/14/99","['World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Collection (2000)', 'British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Collection (2000)']","83753","['24425', '29552', '22318', '6030', '1428']","91","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374048926l/11602.jpg","5709","81",3.63

Fifty-two years later, this horrifying story is a science fiction classic, touted by The Times (London) as having “all the reality of a vividly realized nightmare.”Bill Masen, bandages over his wounded eyes, misses the most spectacular meteorite shower England has ever seen. Removing his bandages the next morning, he finds masses of sightless people wandering the city. He soon meets Josella, another lucky person who has retained her sight, and together they leave the city, aware that the safe, familiar world they knew a mere twenty-four hours before is gone forever.But to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one must survive the Triffids, strange plants that years before began appearing all over the world. The Triffids can grow to over seven feet tall, pull their roots from the ground to walk, and kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers. With society in shambles, they are now poised to prey on humankind. Wyndham chillingly anticipates bio-warfare and mass destruction, fifty years before their realization, in this prescient account of Cold War paranoia.","English","9780812967128","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Horror', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Apocalyptic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels']","['Bill Masen', 'Josella Playton']","Paperback","","228","Modern Library","July 1st 2003","10/28/51","['International Fantasy Award Nominee for Fiction (1952)']","89728","['30638', '35616', '18896', '3561', '1017']","95","['London, England', 'United Kingdom']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320530145l/530965.jpg","5614","80",8.32

As descendants of the House of Life, the Kanes have some powers at their command, but the devious gods haven't given them much time to master their skills at Brooklyn House, which has become a training ground for young magicians. And now their most threatening enemy yet - the chaos snake Apophis - is rising. If they don't prevent him from breaking free in a few days' time, the world will come to an end. In other words, it's a typical week for the Kane family. To have any chance of battling the Forces of Chaos, the Kanes must revive the sun god Ra. But that would be a feat more powerful than any magician has ever accomplished. First they have to search the world for the three sections of the Book of Ra, then they have to learn how to chant its spells. Oh, and did we mention that no one knows where Ra is exactly? Narrated in two different wisecracking voices, featuring a large cast of new and unforgettable characters, and with adventures spanning the globe, this second installment in the Kane Chronicles is nothing short of a thrill ride.","English","9781423140566","['Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Adventure', 'Magic', 'Childrens', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Young Adult Fantasy']","['Bast', 'Bes', 'Isis', 'Anubis', 'Osiris', 'Horus (God)', 'Carter Kane', 'Sadie Kane', 'Zia Rashid', 'Thoth', 'Khufu', 'Babi', 'Ra', 'Set', 'Nephthys', 'Sobek (Death Comes as the End)', 'Taweret', 'Nekhbet', 'Apophis', 'Vladimir Menshikov', 'Walt Stone', 'Khepri', 'Khnum', 'Khonsu', 'Ptah']","Hardcover","","452","Hyperion Books for Children","May 3rd 2011","","[""Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Middle Grade & Children's (2011)""]","161734","['72833', '55982', '26277', '4987', '1655']","96","['Brooklyn, New York City, New York (United States)', 'Duat', 'Alexandria (Egypt)', 'London, England', 'Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366227973l/9067850.jpg","5570","77",4.93

Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after the Dark Knight's retirement. Crime runs rampant in the streets, and the man who was Batman is still tortured by the memories of his parents' murders. As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles. The Dark Knight returns in a blaze of fury, taking on a whole new generation of criminals and matching their level of violence. He is soon joined by this generation's Robin—a girl named Carrie Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths? And more important, can anyone survive the coming fallout of an undeclared war between the superpowers—or a clash of what were once the world's greatest superheroes?Over fifteen years after its debut, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns remains an undisputed classic and one of the most influential stories ever told in the comics medium.Collecting Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1-4","English","9781563893414","['Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Batman', 'Fiction', 'Comic Book', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Dc Comics', 'Superheroes', 'Fantasy', 'Classics']","['Oliver Queen', 'Harvey Dent', 'Alfred Pennyworth', 'Carrie Kelley', 'James Gordon', 'Selina Kyle', 'Bruce Wayne', 'Joker', 'Superman']","Hardcover","","197","DC Comics","November 2012","01/28/86","[]","161494","['84169', '47439', '20566', '5702', '3618']","94","['United States of America']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327892039l/59960.jpg","5558","77",26.34

Instead, it's Lord Vetinari, supreme ruler of Ankh-Morpork, who promptly offers him a job as Postmaster. Since his only other option is a nonliving one, Moist accepts the position - and the hulking golem watchdog who comes along with it, just in case Moist was considering abandoning his responsibilities prematurely. Getting the moribund Postal Service up and running again, however, may be a near-impossible task, what with literally mountains of decades-old undelivered mail clogging every nook and cranny of the broken-down post office building; and with only a few creaky old postmen and one rather unstable, pin-obsessed youth available to deliver it. Worse still, Moist could swear the mail is talking to him. Worst of all, it means taking on the gargantuan, money-hungry Grand Trunk clacks communication monopoly and its bloodthirsty piratical head, Mr. Reacher Gilt.But it says on the building Neither Rain Nor Snow Nor Glom of Nit...Inspiring words (admittedly, some of the bronze letters have been stolen), and for once in his wretched life Moist is going to fight. And if the bold and impossible are what's called for, he'll do it - in order to move the mail, continue breathing, get the girl, and specially deliver that invaluable commodity that every human being (not to mention troll, dwarf, and, yes, even golem) requires: hope.","English","9780060502935","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Comedy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'High Fantasy']","['Moist von Lipwig', 'Havelock Vetinari', 'Adora Belle Dearheart', 'Mr. Pump', 'Stanley Howler', 'Tolliver Groat', 'Reacher Gilt']","Mass Market Paperback","","394","HarperTorch","September 27th 2005","09/25/04","['Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (2005)', 'Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2005)', 'Geffen Award for Best Translated Fantasy Book (2014)', 'Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize Nominee for Comic Fiction (2005)', 'Tähtifantasia Award Nominee (2013)', 'Margaret A.

"13103.The_Celestine_Prophecy","The Celestine Prophecy","Celestine Prophecy #1","James Redfield","3.65","Are three decades of interest in modern physics, ecology, mystical religion and interpersonal psychology finally synthesizing into a new spiritual ""common sense""? Are we now beginning to live this new common sense? Can it become the dominant paradigm of the next century?When James Redfield first published this extraordinary book -- an adventure in pursuit of a spiritual mystery -- people picked it up, read it, and were stunned by its contents. They told their friends about it, and friends in turn told their friends. By word of mouth alone, news of this magical, moving work spread throughout the country, until -- within months of its first printing -- over hundred thousand readers had become excited by its predictions and touched by the way it made sense of what was happening in their lives.Now you can discover for yourself the insights, the vision, and the uncanny accuracy of ""The Celestine Prophecy"". A parable filled with vital truth that reads like a gripping adventure-tale, it begins with the disappearance of an ancient Peruvian manuscript. Although few Westerners know of its existence and a government wants to suppress it, this precious document contains an important secret: the 9 insights the human race is predicted to grasp as we enter an era of true spiritual awareness.To find the manuscript -- and its hidden treasures -- you will join one person's search. It is a quest that will carry you high into the Andes mountains, to ancient ruins deep in old-growth forest, and to a startling discovery. You will quickly recognize the truth of the First Insight: in each of our lives occur mysterious coincidences -- sudden, synchronistic events that, once interpreted, lead us into our true destiny.When you find and understand all 9 of the insights, you will have an exciting new image of human life, and a positive vision of how we will save this planet, its creatures, and its beauty. ""The Celestine Prophecy"" will give you hope…and chills…as you begin to perceive its predictions unfolding all around you in intimate relationships and international affairs. And you will suddenly recognize the quantum leap forward humankind is preparing to make as we approach the new millennium. Important works such as Carlos Castaneda's ""The Teachings of Don Juan"" and the prophecies of Nostradamus have helped prepare the way for the revelations you will find in James Redfield's life-changing words. The time is right to hear them, and to discover the personal journey that is opening in your life.","English","9999999999999","['Fiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'New Age', 'Religion', 'Fantasy', 'Inspirational', 'Adventure', 'Novels']","[]","Paperback","","247","Warner Books","1995","10/28/93","[]","95528","['30105', '26540', '21768', '10048', '7067']","82","['Peru (Perú) (Peru)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1166542346l/13103.jpg","5409","75",""

Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England’s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn’t quite match her name (Jamaican for “no problem”). Samad’s late-in-life arranged marriage (he had to wait for his bride to be born), produces twin sons whose separate paths confound Iqbal’s every effort to direct them, and a renewed, if selective, submission to his Islamic faith. Set against London’s racial and cultural tapestry, venturing across the former empire and into the past as it barrels toward the future, White Teeth revels in the ecstatic hodgepodge of modern life, flirting with disaster, confounding expectations, and embracing the comedy of daily existence.","English","9780375703867","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Adult Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Adult']","['Alfred Archibald Jones', 'Samad Miah Iqbal', 'Clara Bowden', 'Alsana Begum', 'Irie Ambrosia Jones', 'Millat Zulfikar Iqbal', 'Hortense Bowden', 'Mr Topps', 'Joyce Chalfen', 'Marcus Chalfen', 'Magid Iqbal', 'Joshua Chalfen']","Paperback","","448","Vintage","June 12th 2001","04/01/00","['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Shortlist (2000)', 'Guardian First Book Award (2000)', 'James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction (2000)', 'Whitbread Award for First Novel (2000)', 'John Llewellyn Rhys Prize Nominee (2000)', 'Puddly Award for Debut Novel (2001)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (2000)', ""Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book Overall (2001)"", 'Sunday Times/Peters Fraser + Dunlop Young Writer of the Year Award (2001)', 'Betty Trask Award (2001)']","124344","['32686', '47595', '30901', '9711', '3451']","89","['Willesden, North London (United Kingdom)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374739885l/3711.jpg","5243","75",2.49

The survivor of a troubled childhood, he has taken refuge in the world of books and spends his nights spinning baroque tales about the city’s underworld. But perhaps his dark imaginings are not as strange as they seem, for in a locked room deep within the house lie photographs and letters hinting at the mysterious death of the previous owner. Like a slow poison, the history of the place seeps into his bones as he struggles with an impossible love. Close to despair, David receives a letter from a reclusive French editor, Andreas Corelli, who makes him the offer of a lifetime. He is to write a book unlike anything that has ever existed — a book with the power to change hearts and minds. In return, he will receive a fortune, and perhaps more. But as David begins the work, he realizes that there is a connection between his haunting book and the shadows that surround his home.Once again, Zafon takes us into a dark, gothic universe first seen in The Shadow of the Wind and creates a breathtaking adventure of intrigue, romance, and tragedy. Through a dizzyingly constructed labyrinth of secrets, the magic of books, passion, and friendship blend into a masterful story.(jacket)","English","9780385528702","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy', 'Spain', 'Books About Books', 'Gothic', 'Magical Realism', 'Historical', 'Spanish Literature']","['David Martín', 'Isabella Gispert', 'Andreas Corelli', 'Pedro Vidal', 'Cristina Sagnier', 'Diego Marlasca']","Hardcover","","531","Doubleday","June 16th 2009","04/17/08","[]","115611","['36737', '44364', '25925', '6744', '1841']","93","['Spain', 'Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388330801l/4912857.jpg","5207","64",5.55

There, an apple tree bearing fruit of magical properties looms over a garden filled with herbs and edible flowers that possess the power to affect in curious ways anyone who eats them. For nearly a decade, 34-year-old Claire Waverley, at peace with her family inheritance, has lived in the house alone, embracing the spirit of the grandmother who raised her, ruing her mother's unfortunate destiny and seemingly unconcerned about the fate of her rebellious sister, Sydney, who freed herself long ago from their small town's constraints. Using her grandmother's mystical culinary traditions, Claire has built a successful catering business -- and a carefully controlled, utterly predictable life -- upon the family's peculiar gift for making life-altering delicacies: lilac jelly to engender humility, for instance, or rose geranium wine to call up fond memories. Garden Spells reveals what happens when Sydney returns to Bascom with her young daughter, turning Claire's routine existence upside down. With Sydney's homecoming, the magic that the quiet caterer has measured into recipes to shape the thoughts and moods of others begins to influence Claire's own emotions in terrifying and delightful ways. As the sisters reconnect and learn to support one another, each finds romance where she least expects it, while Sydney's child, Bay, discovers both the safe home she has longed for and her own surprising gifts. With the help of their elderly cousin Evanelle, endowed with her own uncanny skills, the Waverley women redeem the past, embrace the present, and take a joyful leap into the future.","English","9780553805482","['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Chick Lit', 'Magic', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Paranormal']","['Emma Clark', 'Claire Waverley', 'Sydney Waverley', 'Tyler Hughes', 'Evanelle Franklin', 'Fred Walker', 'Henry Hopkins', 'Bay Waverley']","Hardcover","","304","Bantam","August 28th 2007","","[]","86660","['32055', '33670', '16311', '3429', '1195']","95","['Bascom, North Carolina (United States)', 'North Carolina (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347309330l/1158967.jpg","5195","67",5.26

"61535.The_Selfish_Gene","The Selfish Gene","","Richard Dawkins (Goodreads Author)","4.14","Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson, and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of The Selfish Gene. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that ""our"" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since.

When the devastating truth comes out, will she resurface this time with one less scar?

"538845.Quo_Vadis","Quo Vadis","","Henryk Sienkiewicz, W.S. Kuniczak (Translator)","4.16","This glorious saga unfolds against the backdrop of ancient Rome--from the Forum to the Coliseum, from banquet halls to summer retreats in Naples, from the luxurious houses of the nobility to the hovels of the poor, Quo Vadis richly depicts a place and time still captivating to the modern imagination. This radiant translation by W.S. Kuniczak restores the original glory and richness of master storyteller Henryk Sienkiewicz's epic tale.Set at a turning point in history (A.D. 54-68), as Christianity replaces the era of corruption and immorality that marked Nero's Rome, Quo Vadis abounds with compelling characters, including:Vinicius, the proud centurion who has fallen deeply in love with a mysterious young woman who disappears the night they meet;Ligia, the elusive beauty. Vinicius will not easily win her love, for she is a Christian, one of the group of dedicated believers led by the apostle Peter. Christians are rare in pagan, hedonistic Rome, and suffer great persecution;Petronius, uncle to Vinicius, an elegant, witty courtier who scoffs at love and religion but finds his nephew's passion charming; andNero himself, enemy of all Christians, a despotic emperor who plunges Rome deeper and deeper into depravity. The decadence of his banquets is staggering; and even worse, his mad laughter is heard echoing in the amphitheater as gladiators duel to the death.As Nero's appalling plans for the Christians become ever clearer, time appears to be running out for the young lovers. Vinicius must come to understand the true meaning of Ligia's religion before it is too late.Grand in scope and ambition, Quo Vadis explores the themes of love, desire and profound moral courage. Lavish descriptions, vivid dialogue and brilliantly drawn characters make this one of the world's greatest epics. Beloved by children and adults the world over, Quo Vadis has been the subject of five films, two of them in English.","English","9780781805506","['Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Polish Literature', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'Romance', 'Christian', 'Novels']","['Nero (emperor)', 'Lygia', 'Marcus Vinicius', 'Paul of Tarsus', 'Ursus', 'Petronius', 'Chilo Chilonides', 'Simon Peter']","Paperback","","589","Hippocrene Books","2006","10/28/94","[]","26430","['12141', '8377', '4265', '1198', '449']","94","['Rome (Italy)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340709653l/538845.jpg","4867","63",2.86

Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about. It's also the wonderful debut of a welcome new star in the constellation of fantasy.","English","9780765350374","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction']","[]","Mass Market Paperback","","638","Tor Fantasy","May 30th 2006","05/01/05","[]","176059","['75282', '67585', '25188', '5128', '2876']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475740953l/68427._SY475_.jpg","4822","58",9.83

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales, a literary genre he so mastered that he himself has become as mythical as the tales he wrote. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories - called eventyrs, or ""fantastic tales"" - express themes that transcend age and nationality.During his lifetime he was acclaimed for having delighted children worldwide and was feted by royalty. Andersen's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages, have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature listeners/readers as well.

Jerome's Three Men in a Boat includes an introduction and notes by Jeremy Lewis in Penguin Classics.Martyrs to hypochondria and general seediness, J. and his friends George and Harris decide that a jaunt up the Thames would suit them to a 'T'. But when they set off, they can hardly predict the troubles that lie ahead with tow-ropes, unreliable weather forecasts and tins of pineapple chunks - not to mention the devastation left in the wake of J.'s small fox-terrier Montmorency. Three Men in a Boat was an instant success when it appeared in 1889, and, with its benign escapism, authorial discursions and wonderful evocation of the late-Victorian 'clerking classes', it hilariously captured the spirit of its age.In his introduction, Jeremy Lewis examines Jerome K.

Fraser’s time-travelling wife, Claire, also knows a couple of things: that the Americans will win, but that the ultimate price of victory is a mystery. What she does believe is that the price won’t include Jamie’s life or happiness — not if she has anything to say.Claire’s grown daughter Brianna, and her husband, Roger, watch the unfolding of Brianna’s parents’ history — a past that may be sneaking up behind their own family.","English","9780752898476","['Historical Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Historical', 'Historical Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Scotland']","['Jamie Fraser', 'Brianna Randall', 'Roger MacKenzie', 'Jeremiah MacKenzie', 'Fergus Fraser', 'Marsali Fraser', 'Germain Fraser', 'Ian Murray', 'Tom Christie', 'Lord John Grey', 'Benedict Arnold', 'Claire Randall Fraser', 'Jenny Murray', 'Young Ian Murray', 'William Ransom', 'Rachel Hunter', 'Denzell Hunter', 'William Buccleigh MacKenzie', 'Amanda MacKenzie', 'Lizzie Wemyss', 'Jo Beardsley', 'Kezzie Beardsley', 'Laoghaire MacKenzie', 'Joan MacKimmie', 'Michael Murray']","Hardcover","UK","1149","Orion","January 21st 2010","09/22/09","['DABWAHA Romance Tournament for Best Novel with Romantic Elements/Crossover (2010)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Romance (2009)']","117360","['69026', '34312', '11507', '1888', '627']","98","[""Fraser's Ridge, North Carolina (United States)"", 'Saratoga, New York (United States)', 'Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States)', 'Wilmington, North Carolina (United States)', 'Lallybroch, Scotland (United Kingdom)', 'Lallybroch, Scotland (United Kingdom)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1370918297l/2832909.jpg","4711","59",2.7

His best-known work tells the tale of Rubashov, a Bolshevik 1917 revolutionary who is cast out, imprisoned and tried for treason by the Soviet government he'd helped create.Darkness at Noon stands as an unequaled fictional portrayal of the nightmare politics of our time. Its hero is an aging revolutionary, imprisoned and psychologically tortured by the Party to which he has dedicated his life. As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases, he relives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and human betrayals of a totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance. Almost unbearably vivid in its depiction of one man's solitary agony, it asks questions about ends and means that have relevance not only for the past but for the perilous present. It is —- as the Times Literary Supplement has declared —- ""A remarkable book, a grimly fascinating interpretation of the logic of the Russian Revolution, indeed of all revolutionary dictatorships, and at the same time a tense and subtly intellectualized drama.""","English","9780553265958","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Politics', 'Russia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Dystopia', '20th Century', 'Thriller']","['Nicolas Salmanovitch Rubashov']","Mass Market Paperback","","216","Bantam Books","March 1984","10/28/40","[]","26243","['9852', '9931', '4743', '1175', '542']","93","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1290053535l/30672.jpg","4670","60",4.18

After losing her job when the Garmin factory shuts down, Nonie is left with major money issues—as in, she has none. Desperate, she has to turn to the one place she’s avoided working since dropping out of college--her family’s funeral home.It wasn’t that Nonie feared the dead. In fact the opposite was true. She sees them—literally, and had been seeing the dead ever since she can remember. She tried telling her parents about it when she was a child, but they’d vehemently dismissed it to imaginary friends, so she’d stopped talking about it. There were only two people who actually knew Nonie’s secret and knew she was the real deal. One was Buggy Mouton, her best friend since kindergarten, and the other was Guy Skinard, whom Nonie considered her one true love since the day she’d laid eyes on him in high school. Buggy now worked at MeeMaw’s Café off of Main in Clay Point, and Guy, as usual, remained ever at her side—the only difference being he’d died in a freak boating accident nine years ago. Still the prankster even in death, Guy loved causing chaos, especially with men Nonie occasionally dated. She could only imagine what mayhem he might stir up while mirroring her at the funeral home and mingling with the newly departed.Only hours into the first day of her new job, pandemonium engulfs the funeral home, and much to Nonie’s surprise, it has nothing to do with Guy. It’s brought on by the family they’re serving. Seventy-two–year-old Dover Fontenot, the Major of Clay Point, dies in a car accident after indulging in a little extra-curricular activity—only the activity wasn’t with his wife , Hazel. And when Dover’s mistress, Anna Mae Turner, shows up at the funeral home for the visitation hell’s gates rip open and Broussard’s Funeral Home suddenly turns into a geriatric war zone.Amidst the flying hairpieces, canes and curses, Nonie’s best friend, Buggy, decides to drop by the funeral home with news she can’t wait to share. A cable network in New Orleans wants to put together a paranormal investigation team and have them check out purported haunted locations in Louisiana. For every location with solid filming potential, each member of the team gets a five hundred dollar pay check. And Buggy knows without question that if anyone can sniff out the ‘restless’ dead, it’s Nonie.Knowing nothing about paranormal investigation, but lured by the sound of the adventure and the dollar signs circling through her head, Nonie agrees to become part of the Boo Krewe, the name Buggy has formally given the makeshift team.The lure of money may be one thing, but what Nonie doesn’t realize is that occasionally the dead, so excited that someone can actually see and hear them, decide to follow her home, into her bed—the bathroom—the shower. And adding to this new-found frustration, Nonie barely finishes her first investigation when she gets a visit from Anna Mae Turner—the mayor’s former mistress—now dead, as well, and harassingly insistent that Nonie bring her killer to light.Nonie quickly learns that the ‘gift’ she’s carried since birth is really a giant wart on the butt of life—and no amount of Compound W is going to make it go away!","","9781937209049","['Epic', 'Novels', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary']","[]","Paperback","","304","Deborah LeBlanc","May 31st 2018","11/17/15","[]","5680","['2620', '2566', '273', '169', '52']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440442093l/26157586.jpg","4627","51",24.68

Despite their best efforts, Carter and Sadie Kane can't seem to keep Apophis, the chaos snake, down. Now Apophis is threatening to plunge the world into eternal darkness, and the Kanes are faced with the impossible task of having to destroy him once and for all. Unfortunately, the magicians of the House of Life are on the brink of civil war, the gods are divided, and the young initiates of Brooklyn House stand almost alone against the forces of chaos. The Kanes' only hope is an ancient spell that might turn the serpent's own shadow into a weapon, but the magic has been lost for a millennia. To find the answer they need, the Kanes must rely on the murderous ghost of a powerful magician who might be able to lead them to the serpent's shadow . . . or might lead them to their deaths in the depths of the underworld.

"1768603.The_White_Tiger","The White Tiger","","Aravind Adiga","3.74","Introducing a major literary talent, The White Tiger offers a story of coruscating wit, blistering suspense, and questionable morality, told by the most volatile, captivating, and utterly inimitable narrator that this millennium has yet seen. Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life—having nothing but his own wits to help him along. Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (""Love -- Rape -- Revenge!""), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own. Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international publishing sensation —and a startling, provocative debut.","English","9781416562597","['Fiction', 'India', 'Contemporary', 'Indian Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asia', 'Book Club', 'Crime']","['Balram Halwai', 'Ashok', 'Kishan', 'Kusum', 'Stork']","Hardcover","","276","Free Press","2008","","['Booker Prize (2008)', 'John Llewellyn Rhys Prize Nominee (2008)', 'PEN/Robert W.

Beah tells how, at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he’d been picked up by the government army, and became a soldier.My new friends have begun to suspect I haven’t told them the full story of my life.“Why did you leave Sierra Leone?”“Because there is a war.”“You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?”“Yes, all the time.”“Cool.”I smile a little.“You should tell us about it sometime.”“Yes, sometime.” This is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.In A Long Way Gone, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence.

Yet they suffice for us to call him great because of their wonderful intelligence, their wealth of invention, and their tight, almost mathematical style.""Labyrinths is a representative selection of Borges' writing, some forty pieces drawn from various books of his published over the years. The translations are by Harriet de Onis, Anthony Kerrigan, and others, including the editors, who have provided a biographical and critical introduction, as well as an extensive bibliography.","Multiple languages","9780811200127","['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Magical Realism', 'Fantasy', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Latin American', 'Literary Fiction']","[]","Paperback","English/Spanish Expanded ed.","256","New Directions","1964","10/28/62","[]","27587","['16825', '7514', '2475', '567', '206']","97","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388286895l/17717.jpg","4429","56",3.64

"7905092-freedom","Freedom","","Jonathan Franzen","3.76","Patty and Walter Berglund were the new pioneers of old St. Paul—the gentrifiers, the hands-on parents, the avant-garde of the Whole Foods generation. Patty was the ideal sort of neighbor, who could tell you where to recycle your batteries and how to get the local cops to actually do their job. She was an enviably perfect mother and the wife of Walter's dreams. Together with Walter—environmental lawyer, commuter cyclist, total family man—she was doing her small part to build a better world.But now, in the new millennium, the Berglunds have become a mystery. Why has their teenage son moved in with the aggressively Republican family next door? Why has Walter taken a job working with Big Coal? What exactly is Richard Katz—outré rocker and Walter's college best friend and rival—still doing in the picture? Most of all, what has happened to Patty? Why has the bright star of Barrier Street become ""a very different kind of neighbor,"" an implacable Fury coming unhinged before the street's attentive eyes?In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.(jacket)","English","9780374158460","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'American', 'Adult Fiction', 'Family', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club']","['Walter Berglund', 'Patty Berglund', 'Joey Berglund', 'Jessica Berglund', 'Richard Katz']","Hardcover","","562","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","August 31st 2010","08/28/10","['Warwick Prize for Writing Nominee for Longlist (2013)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2010)', 'Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Fiction (2011)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (2010)', 'Bad Sex in Fiction Award Nominee (2010)', 'John Gardner Book Award for Fiction (2011)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Favorite Book and for Fiction (2010)']","150235","['42269', '55185', '33341', '12890', '6550']","87","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316729686l/7905092.jpg","4245","52",3.31

Following the prides and passions of a group of Jews, Romans and Barbarians living at the time of the siege, the narrative is centered on an ill-fated romance between a steadfast slave girl, Hadassah, and Marcus, the brother of her owner and a handsome aristocrat. After surviving the massacre of her family and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, Hadassah is captured and sold to a well-to-do merchant’s family. Brought to Rome, she is pressed into service as a personal slave to hedonistic Julia Valerian. Hadassah struggles to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and to treat her masters in a manner in keeping with His teachings, but she is forced to keep her religious identity a secret in order to survive. Confused and alone, she has only her faith to cling to as she tries to subtly bring God into the lives of her captors. Reckless, impulsive, and villainous, Julia tries to undermine Hadassah at every turn. But Julia’s brother, Marcus, is a different sort altogether. Is it possible for a love between Hadassah and Marcus to flourish considering not only their differing stations in life, but also the gap between Hadassah’s unrelenting faith and Marcus’ lack of belief in anything? Simultaneously, Atretes, a captured soldier from Germania, is forced to become a gladiator. This is the time of Rome’s decline and the decadence of a civilization on the verge of self-destruction serves as a powerful backdrop to the Barbarian’s struggle for survival in the arena.","English","9999999999999","['Christian Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Christian', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Historical Romance', 'Christian Romance', 'Adult', 'Religion']","['Atretes', 'Marcus Lucianus Valerian', 'Julia Valerian', 'Hadassah']","Paperback","","520","Tyndale House Publishers","March 1st 1998","03/01/93","[]","75055","['53802', '13672', '4638', '1551', '1392']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459567327l/95617.jpg","4242","51",""

"24830.The_Illustrated_Man","The Illustrated Man","","Ray Bradbury","4.13","That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as ""The Veldt,"" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or ""Kaleidoscope,"" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or ""Zero Hour,"" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley WiaterContents:· Prologue: The Illustrated Man · ss * · The Veldt [“The World the Children Made”] · ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 ’50 · Kaleidoscope · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct ’49 · The Other Foot · ss New Story Magazine Mar ’51 · The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] · ss Copy Spr ’50 · The Man · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb ’49 · The Long Rain [“Death-by-Rain”] · ss Planet Stories Sum ’50 · The Rocket Man · ss Maclean’s Mar 1 ’51 · The Fire Balloons [“‘In This Sign...’”] · ss Imagination Apr ’51 · The Last Night of the World · ss Esquire Feb ’51 · The Exiles [“The Mad Wizards of Mars”] · ss Maclean’s Sep 15 ’49; F&SF Win ’50 · No Particular Night or Morning · ss * · The Fox and the Forest [“To the Future”] · ss Colliers May 13 ’50 · The Visitor · ss Startling Stories Nov ’48 · The Concrete Mixer · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr ’49 · Marionettes, Inc.

Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into The Power of Now. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolise ""break time"". This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read.

But soon Bazarov’s outspoken rejection of authority and social conventions touches off quarrels, misunderstandings, and romantic entanglements that will utterly transform the Kirsanov household and reflect the changes taking place across all of nineteenth-century Russia. Fathers and Sons enraged the old and the young, reactionaries, romantics, and radicals alike when it was first published. At the same time, Turgenev won the acclaim of Flaubert, Maupassant, and Henry James for his craftsmanship as a writer and his psychological insight. Fathers and Sons is now considered one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century.A timeless depiction of generational conflict during social upheaval, it vividly portrays the clash between the older Russian aristocracy and the youthful radicalism that foreshadowed the revolution to come—and offers modern-day readers much to reflect upon as they look around at their own tumultuous, ever changing world.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader’s guide and bonus content.","English","9780307352149","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Science', 'Business', 'Audiobook', 'Personal Development', 'Sociology', 'Leadership', 'Adult']","[]","Hardcover","First Edition (U.S.)","333","Crown Publishing Group/Random House, Inc.","January 24th 2012","","['Guardian First Book Award Nominee for Longlist (2012)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (Shortlist) (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Nonfiction (2012)']","323829","['126571', '119856', '55832', '14027', '7543']","93","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328562861l/8520610.jpg","4143","51",5.26

What they weren't expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed--a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy's trip to heaven and back.Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery--and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how ""really, really big"" God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton's uniquely simple words, ""Heaven is for Real"" offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, ""Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses.""""Heaven is for Real"" will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering you the chance to see, and believe, like a child.","English","9780849946158","['Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Inspirational', 'Spirituality', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Faith', 'Christianity', 'Christian Non Fiction']","[]","Paperback","","162","Thomas Nelson","2010","","[]","276970","['121313', '77785', '49855', '16966', '11051']","90","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348467278l/7933292.jpg","4141","57",1.45

"17803.After_Dark","After Dark","","Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin (Translator)","3.71","A short, sleek novel of encounters set in Tokyo during the witching hours between midnight and dawn, and every bit as gripping as Haruki Murakami’s masterworks The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Kafka on the Shore.At its center are two sisters—Eri, a fashion model slumbering her way into oblivion, and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Denny’s toward people whose lives are radically alien to her own: a jazz trombonist who claims they’ve met before, a burly female “love hotel” manager and her maid staff, and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These “night people” are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Eri’s slumber—mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime—will either restore or annihilate her.After Dark moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agency—the interplay between self-expression and empathy, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love. Murakami’s trademark humor, psychological insight, and grasp of spirit and morality are here distilled with an extraordinary, harmonious mastery.","English","9780307265838","['Fiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Magical Realism', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Asia', 'Asian Literature']","['Eri Asai', 'Kaoru', 'Mari Asai', 'Takahashi Tetsuya', 'Shirakawa']","Hardcover","","191","Knopf Publishing Group","May 8th 2007","10/28/04","['International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2009)']","110117","['22389', '44095', '34209', '7901', '1523']","91","['Tokyo (Japan)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437952316l/17803._SY475_.jpg","4088","49",6.48

""He is picking up the same bags with the same clothes Lisa packed and folded a year ago. He wishes he were like his clothes, untouched by external forces."" Family man Nick Blake is living in New York City and working for the United Nations. Born and raised in the United States with broad knowledge of the Afghan culture, he is living the All-American life with his wife, Lisa, and their children. His life is turned upside down when, while on a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan, Nick is kidnapped and finds himself in the clutches of the Taliban. Omar Farhad's debut novel Honor and Polygamy follows Nick throughout his eighteen months in Afghanistan and the devastating and unexpected turns his life takes, as he learns the true meanings of home, history and culture. After being held captive for several months, Nick is forced to marry the sixteen-year-old Shaista. Although he cannot forget his beloved wife and children back home, he finds himself falling in love with his second wife and, overwhelmed with guilt, is torn between his old life and his new one. Honor and Polygamy is far from simply a captivating fiction story, but is also a brilliant commentary on the United States' situation with Afghanistan. Farhad expresses his views on both the political and the cultural sides of Afghanistan. Politically, he is predicting how he feels the war will ultimately end, while culturally, he shows readers not familiar with Afghanistan that the 35-year-old war has created a population, which is uneducated, disloyal, and without identity. The United States and many other nations have continuously disrupted Afghanistan with no clear political objectives, and, in his novel, Farhad explores the consequences of these actions. The story of Nick Blake represents the reality of the Afghan culture and the results and disappointments of the political realities in Afghanistan, and shows readers just how unaware we all are of other cultures. Written by an author who has lived both the American and Afghan ways of life, Honor and Polygamy is a harrowing, haunting and deeply moving tale for our times.","","9781491732953","['Fiction', 'Polygamy']","[]","Paperback","","132","iUniverse","May 7th 2014","05/28/14","[]","156","['91', '36', '13', '8', '8']","90","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400872547l/22242097.jpg","4071","43",10.07

She works through the night, preparing the day’s breads and pastries, trying to escape a reality of loneliness, bad memories, and the shadow of her mother’s death. When Josef Weber, an elderly man in Sage’s grief support group, begins stopping by the bakery, they strike up an unlikely friendship. Despite their differences, they see in each other the hidden scars that others can’t, and they become companions.Everything changes on the day that Josef confesses a long-buried and shameful secret—one that nobody else in town would ever suspect—and asks Sage for an extraordinary favor. If she says yes, she faces not only moral repercussions, but potentially legal ones as well. With her own identity suddenly challenged, and the integrity of the closest friend she’s ever had clouded, Sage begins to question the assumptions and expectations she’s made about her life and her family. When does a moral choice become a moral imperative? And where does one draw the line between punishment and justice, forgiveness and mercy?In this searingly honest novel, Jodi Picoult gracefully explores the lengths we will go in order to protect our families and to keep the past from dictating the future","English","9781439102763","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Holocaust', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'World War II', 'War', 'Drama']","[]","Hardcover","","461","Atria","February 26th 2013","","['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2013)']","173085","['82428', '63552', '20761', '4430', '1914']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356328634l/15753740.jpg","4035","47",3.42

It is a stunning work: a complex tapestry of family tensions, baseball, politics and religion, by turns hilariously funny and agonizingly sad. Highly inventive formally, the novel is mainly narrated by Kincaid Chance, the youngest son in a family of four boys and identical twin girls, the children of Hugh Chance, a discouraged minor-league ballplayer whose once-promising career was curtained by an industrial accident, and his wife Laura, an increasingly fanatical Seventh-Day Adventist. The plot traces the working-out of the family's fate from the beginning of the Eisenhower years through the traumas of Vietnam.","English","9780553378498","['Fiction', 'Baseball', 'Historical Fiction', 'Sports', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Family', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'Religion']","[]","Paperback","","645","Dial Press Trade Paperback","June 1st 1996","10/28/92","['Oregon Book Award Nominee for Fiction (Finalist) (1993)']","13923","['8047', '3944', '1334', '414', '184']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403176622l/19534.jpg","4009","48",5.73

And since Caroline is currently on a self-imposed dating hiatus, and her neighbor is clearly lethally attractive to women, she finds her fantasies keep her awake even longer than the noise. So when the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts Simon Parker, her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. The tension between them is as thick as the walls are thin, and the results just as mixed.

Kramer (Goodreads Author)","4.32","In September of the year 9 A.D., the young Germanic warrior known as Armin to his friends and Arminius to his Roman enemies, successfully took on and defeated three entire Roman legions. This resulted in the deaths of over twenty thousand Roman soldiers. This in turn resulted in the Roman emperor called Tiberius recalling all Roman military units from Germania. The Germanic tribes would associate for their common good, often meeting and forming up for offensive or defensive war, but they were always separate and very independent. Armin knew that the best way to ensure that his country was not bothered by outside invaders again was to become a single country complete with it own army and navy. In this he crossed swords with the independent temper of his own people. They did not want any king from anywhere telling them what to do. In due course, this resulted in even the members of his own family taking up arms against him in order to make sure that the tribes of Germania remained independent and free.

"1379961.People_of_the_Book","People of the Book","","Geraldine Brooks (Goodreads Author)","4.02","From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of March, the journey of a rare illuminated manuscript through centuries of exile and warIn 1996, Hanna Heath, an Australian rare-book expert, is offered the job of a lifetime: analysis and conservation of the famed Sarajevo Haggadah, which has been rescued from Serb shelling during the Bosnian war. Priceless and beautiful, the book is one of the earliest Jewish volumes ever to be illuminated with images. When Hanna, a caustic loner with a passion for her work, discovers a series of tiny artifacts in its ancient binding—an insect wing fragment, wine stains, salt crystals, a white hair—she begins to unlock the book’s mysteries. The reader is ushered into an exquisitely detailed and atmospheric past, tracing the book’s journey from its salvation back to its creation. In Bosnia during World War II, a Muslim risks his life to protect it from the Nazis. In the hedonistic salons of fin-de-siècle Vienna, the book becomes a pawn in the struggle against the city’s rising anti-Semitism. In inquisition-era Venice, a Catholic priest saves it from burning. In Barcelona in 1492, the scribe who wrote the text sees his family destroyed by the agonies of enforced exile. And in Seville in 1480, the reason for the Haggadah’s extraordinary illuminations is finally disclosed. Hanna’s investigation unexpectedly plunges her into the intrigues of fine art forgers and ultra-nationalist fanatics. Her experiences will test her belief in herself and the man she has come to love. Inspired by a true story, People of the Book is at once a novel of sweeping historical grandeur and intimate emotional intensity, an ambitious, electrifying work by an acclaimed and beloved author.","English","9999999999999","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Books About Books', 'Mystery', 'Book Club', 'Jewish', 'Religion', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook']","['Hanna Heath', 'Ozren Karaman', 'Serif Kamal', 'Stela Kamal', 'Amitai Yomtov', 'Werner Heinrich', 'Razmus Kanaha', 'Dr. Franz Hirschfeldt', 'Florien Mittl', 'Giovanni Domenico Vistorini', 'Judah Aryeh', 'Sarah Heath', 'David Ben Shoushan', 'Ruth Ben Shoushan', 'Joseph Ben Shoushan', 'Reuben Ben Shoushan', 'Rosa del Salvador', 'Zahra bint Ibrahim al-Tarek', 'Aaron Sharansky']","Hardcover","","372","Viking Books","October 1st 2008","01/28/08","['National Jewish Book Award Nominee (2008)', 'Massachusetts Book Award for Fiction (2009)', ""Prime Minister's Literary Awards Nominee for Fiction (2009)"", 'Barbara Jefferis Award Nominee (2009)', 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) for Literary Fiction and for Book of the Year (2008)', 'Mary Shelley Award for Outstanding Fictional Work (2009)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2010)']","123160","['43804', '47731', '24218', '5688', '1719']","94","['Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina)', 'Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina)', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442955497l/1379961._SY475_.jpg","3941","58",""

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.The final volume of the Wheel of Time, A Memory of Light,  was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, New York Times bestselling author of the Mistborn books, and now Stormlight Archive, among others, was chosen by Jordan's editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final volume, later expanded to three books.In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.","English","9780765302304","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'Magic', 'Adult']","[""Rand al'Thor"", ""Nynaeve al'Meara"", ""Egwene al'Vere"", 'Perrin Aybara', ""Al'Lan Mandragoran"", 'Matrim Cauthon', 'Moiraine Damodred', 'Min Farshaw', 'Elayne Trakand', 'Aviendha', 'Siuan Sanche']","Hardcover","First Edition","783","Tor Books","October 27th 2009","","['David Gemmell Legend Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2010)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy (2009)']","127727","['69684', '40702', '12999', '2768', '1574']","97","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442815923l/1166599._SY475_.jpg","3827","53",5.99
"35133922-educated","Educated","","Tara Westover (Goodreads Author)","4.47","Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here","English","9780399590504","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Education', 'Religion']","[]","Hardcover","","334","Random House","February 20th 2018","","['Audie Award for Best Female Narrator (2019)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Biography (2018)', 'ALA Alex Award (2019)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee for Longlist (2019)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Autobiography (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2018)', 'PEN/Jean Stein Book Award Nominee for Shortlist (2019)', 'Reading Women Award for Nonfiction (2018)']","796019","['477689', '236894', '62027', '12742', '6667']","98","['Idaho Mountains (United States)', 'Idaho (United States)', 'Arizona (United States)', 'Rome (Italy)', 'Paris (France)', 'Palmyra, New York (United States)', 'Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Cambridge, England (United Kingdom)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635l/35133922.jpg","3826","42",5.42

Joaquín takes off for San Francisco to seek his fortune, and Eliza, pregnant with his child, decides to follow him.As we follow her spirited heroine on a perilous journey north in the hold of a ship to the rough-and-tumble world of San Francisco and northern California, we enter a world whose newly arrived inhabitants are driven mad by gold fever. A society of single men and prostitutes among whom Eliza moves--with the help of her good friend and savior, the Chinese doctor Tao Chien--California opens the door to a new life of freedom and independence for the young Chilean. Her search for the elusive Joaquín gradually turns into another kind of journey that transforms her over time, and what began as a search for love ends up as the conquest of personal freedom.","English","9780061120251","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Magical Realism', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Spanish Literature']","['Eliza Sommers', 'Rose Sommers', 'Joaquín Andieta', 'Jacob Todd', ""Tao Chi'en""]","Paperback","","432","Harper Perennial","May 2nd 2006","10/28/98","['Premio de traducción literaria Valle Inclán Nominee for Margaret Sayers Peden (2000)']","115142","['33237', '46729', '27609', '5815', '1752']","93","['California (United States)', 'Valparaíso (Chile)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1299666780l/16527.jpg","3779","59",6.45

Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.","English","9780345409461","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'History', 'Skepticism', 'Atheism', 'Popular Science', 'Physics', 'Psychology']","[]","Paperback","","459","Ballantine Books","February 25th 1997","02/01/96","['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Science and Technology (1996)']","59021","['30989', '17544', '7103', '2058', '1327']","94","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553691804l/17349._SX318_.jpg","3701","42",15.19

Its characters are brilliant conversationalists, including the princesses Rosalind and Celia and their Fool, Touchstone. Soon after Rosalind and Orlando meet and fall in love, the princesses and Touchstone go into exile in the Forest of Arden, where they find new conversational partners. Duke Frederick, younger brother to Duke Senior, has overthrown his brother and forced him to live homeless in the forest with his courtiers, including the cynical Jaques. Orlando, whose older brother Oliver plotted his death, has fled there, too.Recent scholars have also grounded the play in the issues of its time. These include primogeniture, passing property from a father to his oldest son. As You Like It depicts intense conflict between brothers, exposing the human suffering that primogeniture entails. Another perspective concerns cross-dressing. Most of Orlando’s courtship of Rosalind takes place while Rosalind is disguised as a man, “Ganymede.” At her urging, Orlando pretends that Ganymede is his beloved Rosalind. But as the epilogue reveals, the sixteenth-century actor playing Rosalind was male, following the practice of the time. In other words, a boy played a girl playing a boy pretending to be a girl.","English","9780743484862","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'School', 'Poetry', 'Comedy']","['Rosalind', 'Touchstone']","Paperback","Folger Shakespeare Library Edition","263","Simon Schuster","August 23rd 2011","10/28/99","[]","71237","['19650', '26197', '19893', '4501', '996']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1561383241l/42607._SY475_.jpg","3672","67",2.66

Arranged chronologically, this collection shows that her last story, ""Judgement Day"" - sent to her publisher shortly before her death - is a brilliantly rewritten and transfigured version of ""The Geranium."" Taken together, these stories reveal a lively, penetrating talent that has given us some of the most powerful and disturbing fiction of the twentieth century.

This literary rendering of the life of Jesus Christ has courted controversy since its publication by depicting a Christ far more human than the one seen in the Bible. He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other—subject to fear, doubt, and pain.  In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God’s will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ’s ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.  “Spiritual dynamite.” —San Francisco Chronicle  “A searing, soaring, shocking novel.” —Time ","English","9780684852560","['Fiction', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Greece', 'Christianity', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality']","[]","Paperback","","506","Simon Schuster","March 1st 1998","10/28/55","[]","12131","['5463', '4131', '1861', '474', '202']","94","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481512264l/8737._SY475_.jpg","3626","51",5.92

London, dissatisfied with the rewards of his own success, intended Martin Eden as an attack on individualism and a criticism of ambition; however, much of its status as a classic has been conferred by admirers of its ambitious protagonist.Andrew Sinclair's wide-ranging introduction discusses the conflict between London's support of socialism and his powerful self-will.

"318431.Long_Walk_to_Freedom","Long Walk to Freedom","Long Walk to Freedom #1-2","Nelson Mandela","4.33","Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose, he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in a Jewish firm in Johannesburg, of his slow political awakening, and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family, the anguished breakup of his first marriage, and the painful separations from his children. He brings vividly to life the escalating political warfare in the fifties between the ANC and the government, culminating in his dramatic escapades as an underground leader and the notorious Rivonia Trial of 1964, at which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Herecounts the surprisingly eventful twenty-seven years in prison and the complex, delicate negotiations that led both to his freedom and to the beginning of the end of apartheid. Finally he provides the ultimate inside account.","English","9780316548182","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Africa', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Politics', 'South Africa', 'Biography Memoir', 'Race']","['Nelson Mandela']","Paperback","","656","Back Bay Books","October 1st 1995","10/28/94","['Alan Paton Award (1995)']","67778","['36085', '21649', '7405', '1549', '1090']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327997342l/318431.jpg","3581","44",3.07

Admirers of Doré will find ample evidence here of his characteristic ability to capture the mood and meaning of a work of literature in striking imagery; lovers of The Raven will delight in seeing its mournful musing on love and loss given dramatic pictorial form.","English","9780486290720","['Classics', 'Poetry', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Gothic', 'School', 'Literature', 'American', 'Mystery']","[]","Paperback","","64","Dover Publications","April 25th 1996","10/28/45","[]","101241","['51183', '32352', '14177', '2682', '847']","97","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347398489l/264158.jpg","3571","53",10.94

Houser (Illustrator)","4.04","Bestselling author Barbara Kingsolver returns with her first nonfiction narrative that will open your eyes in a hundred new ways to an old truth: You are what you eat. ""As the U.S. population made an unprecedented mad dash for the Sun Belt, one carload of us paddled against the tide, heading for the Promised Land where water falls from the sky and green stuff grows all around. We were about to begin the adventure of realigning our lives with our food chain. ""Naturally, our first stop was to buy junk food and fossil fuel..."" Hang on for the ride: With characteristic poetry and pluck, Barbara Kingsolver and her family sweep readers along on their journey away from the industrial-food pipeline to a rural life in which they vow to buy only food raised in their own neighborhood, grow it themselves, or learn to live without it. Their good-humored search yields surprising discoveries about turkey sex life and overly zealous zucchini plants, en route to a food culture that's better for the neighborhood and also better on the table. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, Animal, Vegetable, Miracle makes a passionate case for putting the kitchen back at the center of family life and diversified farms at the center of the American diet. ""This is the story of a year in which we made every attempt to feed ourselves animals and vegetables whose provenance we really knew . . . and of how our family was changed by our first year of deliberately eating food produced from the same place where we worked, went to school, loved our neighbors, drank the water, and breathed the air.""","English","9780060852559","['Nonfiction', 'Food', 'Memoir', 'Gardening', 'Health', 'Environment', 'Cooking', 'Audiobook', 'Nature', 'Biography']","[]","Hardcover","","370","HarperCollins Publishers","May 1st 2007","","['Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Nonfiction (2008)', 'Green Prize for Sustainable Literature']","98861","['38491', '35445', '17737', '5232', '1956']","93","['Virginia (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480104279l/25460._SY475_.jpg","3460","50",3.28

Their quest: to track down the obscure, vanished poet Cesárea Tinajero. A violent showdown in the Sonora desert turns search to flight; twenty years later Belano and Lima are still on the run.The explosive first long work by “the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time” (Ilan Stavans, Los Angeles Times), The Savage Detectives follows Belano and Lima through the eyes of the people whose paths they cross in Central America, Europe, Israel, and West Africa. This chorus includes the muses of visceral realism, the beautiful Font sisters; their father, an architect interned in a Mexico City asylum; a sensitive young follower of Octavio Paz; a foul-mouthed American graduate student; a French girl with a taste for the Marquis de Sade; the great-granddaughter of Leon Trotsky; a Chilean stowaway with a mystical gift for numbers; the anorexic heiress to a Mexican underwear empire; an Argentinian photojournalist in Angola; and assorted hangers-on, detractors, critics, lovers, employers, vagabonds, real-life literary figures, and random acquaintances.A polymathic descendant of Borges and Pynchon, Roberto Bolaño traces the hidden connection between literature and violence in a world where national boundaries are fluid and death lurks in the shadow of the avant-garde. The Savage Detectives is a dazzling original, the first great Latin American novel of the twenty-first century.","English","9780374191481","['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Latin American Literature', 'Unfinished', '20th Century']","['Ulises Lima', 'Arturo Belano', 'Auxilio Lacouture', 'Ernesto San Epifanio', 'María Font', 'Angélica Font', 'Julio César Álamo', 'Cesárea Tinajero', 'Laura Jáuregui', 'Alberto Moore']","Hardcover","","577","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","April 3rd 2007","11/02/98","['Premio Herralde de Novela (1998)', 'Premio Internacional de Novela Rómulo Gallegos (1999)', 'BTBA Best Translated Book Award Nominee for Fiction shortlist (2008)', 'Metų verstinė knyga Nominee (2013)']","32632","['15149', '10153', '4603', '1843', '884']","92","['Mexico City (México City) (Mexico)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1342651149l/63033.jpg","3457","40",4.93

Then, to her amazement, the “coolest girl in the world” moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer’s end they’ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable.So begins Kristin Hannah’s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn’t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she’ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she’ll envy her famous best friend. . . .For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they’ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.Firefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone’s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it’s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It’s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you’ll never forget . . . one you’ll want to pass on to your best friend.","English","9780312364083","['Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Drama', 'Womens Fiction', 'Book Club']","['Kate Mularkey', 'Tully Hart']","Hardcover","","479","St. Martin's Press","February 5th 2008","","[""Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice Award (RT Award) Nominee for Women's Fiction (2008)""]","199333","['79619', '71216', '36532', '8927', '3039']","94","['Seattle, Washington (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362435448l/1472878.jpg","3427","44",5.86

In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran’s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane’s child’s-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.","English","9780375714573","['Graphic Novels', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Comics', 'Biography', 'History', 'Iran', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Autobiography', 'School']","[]","Paperback","","153","Pantheon","June 1st 2004","10/28/03","['Harvey Awards for Best US Edition of Foreign Material (2004)', 'ALA Alex Award (2004)', ""Prix du Festival d'Angoulême for Alph-art du coup de coeur (2001)""]","158488","['73302', '58927', '20645', '3986', '1628']","96","['Iran, Islamic Republic of', 'Tehran (Iran)', 'Persia']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1425871473l/9516.jpg","3399","47",4.15

"18749.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun","Half of a Yellow Sun","","Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie","4.33","A masterly, haunting new novel from a writer heralded by The Washington Post Book World as “the 21st-century daughter of Chinua Achebe,” Half of a Yellow Sun re-creates a seminal moment in modern African history: Biafra’s impassioned struggle to establish an independent republic in Nigeria in the 1960s, and the chilling violence that followed. With astonishing empathy and the effortless grace of a natural storyteller, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie weaves together the lives of three characters swept up in the turbulence of the decade. Thirteen-year-old Ugwu is employed as a houseboy for a university professor full of revolutionary zeal. Olanna is the professor’s beautiful mistress, who has abandoned her life of privilege in Lagos for a dusty university town and the charisma of her new lover. And Richard is a shy young Englishman in thrall to Olanna’s twin sister, an enigmatic figure who refuses to belong to anyone. As Nigerian troops advance and the three must run for their lives, their ideals are severely tested, as are their loyalties to one another. Epic, ambitious, and triumphantly realized, Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel about moral responsibility, about the end of colonialism, about ethnic allegiances, about class and race—and the ways in which love can complicate them all. Adichie brilliantly evokes the promise and the devastating disappointments that marked this time and place, bringing us one of the most powerful, dramatic, and intensely emotional pictures of modern Africa that we have ever had.","English","9781400044160","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Africa', 'Nigeria', 'War', 'Historical', 'African Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction']","['Ugwu', 'Olanna', 'Odenigbo', 'Kainene']","Hardcover","","433","Knopf","September 12th 2006","","['Orange Prize for Fiction (2007)', 'James Tait Black Memorial Prize Nominee for Fiction (2006)', 'Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Fiction (2007)', 'PEN Open Book Award (2007)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (2006)', 'Hurston/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Fiction (2007)', 'Women’s prize for fiction (2007)']","103433","['50213', '39929', '10819', '1855', '617']","98","['Nigeria', 'Biafra', 'Nsukka (Nigeria)', 'Lagos (Nigeria)', 'Kano (Nigeria)', 'Port Harcourt (Nigeria)', 'Abba, Imo (Nigeria)', 'Umuahia (Nigeria)', 'Orlu (Nigeria)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327934717l/18749.jpg","3390","40",16.76

His adventures gave Dickens the opportunity to portray an extraordinary gallery of rogues and eccentrics: Wackford Squeers, the tyrannical headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys; the slow-witted orphan Smike, rescued by Nicholas; and the gloriously theatrical Mr and Mrs Crummles and their daughter, the 'infant phenonenon'.

Within this era of danger and romance, John of Gaunt, the king’s son, falls passionately in love with the already married Katherine. Their well-documented affair and love persist through decades of war, adultery, murder, loneliness, and redemption.

No matter how hard he tries to stay detached, Adam finds himself eyeball deep in Heidi’s problems, as well as the needs of her teenage son and a homeless dog. With conflicting theories abound and tensions running high, it’s up to the ladies of the society to don disguises and go undercover. If they’re not careful, the town may fall to a wrecking ball, Heidi may fall for Adam, and the secret society will be exposed.

"11084145-steve-jobs","Steve Jobs","","Walter Isaacson (Goodreads Author)","4.14","Walter Isaacson's ""enthralling"" (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.","English","9781451648539","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Technology', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']","['Steve Jobs']","Hardcover","","627","Simon & Schuster","October 24th 2011","10/01/11","['Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Shortlist (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for History & Biography (2011)', 'Premio Know Square (2011)']","956505","['440382', '313971', '132464', '35485', '34203']","93","['San Francisco Bay Area, California (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511288482l/11084145._SY475_.jpg","3330","37",2.92

It is even more astonishing that anyone survived it. Stefan grows up in the grip of a raging famine. Stalin’s Five Year Plan brings genocide to Ukraine – millions of people starve to death. To free themselves from the daily terrors of Soviet rule, Stefan and his friends fight imaginary battles in nearby woods to defend their land. The games they play are their only escape. ‘Sliding on the Snow Stone’ is the true story of Stefan's extraordinary journey across a landscape of hunger, fear and devastating loss. With Europe on the brink of World War Two, Stefan and his family pray they'll survive in their uncertain world. They long to be free. (In 1932-33, as part of their drive towards industrialisation, the Soviet Union demanded impossibly high requisitions of grain from rural areas in Ukraine. In a deliberate act of genocide, Ukrainian smallholdings were stripped of food, and the population began to perish, with some estimates as high as 10 million deaths, from starvation. In Ukraine, this atrocity became known as the Holodomor (death by hunger). The following years saw Soviet purges and terrors resulting in the elimination of academics and intellectuals, or of anyone who spoke out against Soviet rule. When World War Two arrived on Ukraine’s doorstep, many people viewed the Nazis as liberators – a view that was quickly proved wrong. ‘Sliding on the Snow Stone’ is Stefan’s personal account of a historical period drenched in the blood of a nation, and of his yearning for freedom).","English","B00KNOQFJS","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Ukraine', 'War', 'Autobiography', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'Survival']","[]","Kindle Edition","","238","Bandura Books","September 21st 2011","","[]","359","['145', '119', '75', '17', '3']","94","['Ukraine']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327983970l/12853168.jpg","3269","33",""

"25899336-when-breath-becomes-air","When Breath Becomes Air","","Paul Kalanithi","4.36","For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.","English","B00XSSYR50","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Philosophy', 'Science']","[]","Kindle Edition","","208","Random House","January 19th 2016","01/12/16","['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for Biography or Autobiography (2017)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee (2017)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2016)', 'Waterstones Book of the Year Nominee (2016)', 'Book of the Month Book of the Year Award Nominee (2016)', 'Jan Michalski Prize Nominee for Longlist (2017)']","415362","['230251', '125568', '43622', '10017', '5904']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492677644l/25899336.jpg","3234","35",""

Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery–or crime? –lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves.

"8600.Eats_Shoots_Leaves","Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation","","Lynne Truss","3.87","In Eats, Shoots & Leaves, former editor Lynne Truss, gravely concerned about our current grammatical state, boldly defends proper punctuation. She proclaims, in her delightfully urbane, witty, and very English way, that it is time to look at our commas and semicolons and see them as the wonderful and necessary things they are. Using examples from literature, history, neighborhood signage, and her own imagination, Truss shows how meaning is shaped by commas and apostrophes, and the hilarious consequences of punctuation gone awry.Featuring a foreword by Frank McCourt, and interspersed with a lively history of punctuation from the invention of the question mark in the time of Charlemagne to George Orwell shunning the semicolon, Eats, Shoots & Leaves makes a powerful case for the preservation of proper punctuation.","English","9781592402038","['Nonfiction', 'Writing', 'Language', 'Reference', 'Humor', 'Linguistics', 'Education', 'Adult', 'British Literature', 'Self Help']","[]","Paperback","","209","The Penguin Group","April 2006","01/02/03","[]","97133","['28620', '36864', '24012', '5758', '1879']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473392595l/8600._SX318_.jpg","3202","53",3.17

When Ruby is entrusted with an explosive secret, she must embark on her most dangerous mission yet: leaving the Children’s League behind.

Gulliver’s Travels is, of course, his world renowned masterpiece in the genre; however, Swift wrote other, shorter works that also offer excellent evidence of his inspired lampoonery. Perhaps the most famous of these is A Modest Proposal, in which he straight-facedly suggests that Ireland could solve its hunger problems by using its children for food. Also included in this collection are The Battle of Books, A Meditation upon a Broomstick, A Discourse Concerning the Mechanical Operations of the Spirit and An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity in England.This inexpensive edition will certainly be welcomed by teachers and students of English literature, but its appeal extends to any reader who delights in watching a master satirist wield words as weapons.","English","9780486287591","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', '18th Century', 'Irish Literature', 'Politics', 'Ireland']","[]","Paperback","","64","Dover Publications","February 2nd 1996","10/28/29","[]","14293","['5334', '5222', '3016', '565', '156']","95","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1264316062l/2677.jpg","3198","53",3.61

A great stone bridge built three centuries ago in the heart of the Balkans by a Grand Vezir of the Ottoman Empire dominates the setting of Andric's stunning novel. Spanning generations, nationalities, and creeds, the bridge stands witness to the countless lives played out upon it: Radisav, the workman, who tries to hinder its construction and is impaled on its highest point; to the lovely Fata, who throws herself from its parapet to escape a loveless marriage; to Milan, the gambler, who risks everything in one last game on the bridge with the devil his opponent; to Fedun, the young soldier, who pays for a moment of spring forgetfulness with his life. War finally destroys the span, and with it the last descendant of that family to which the Grand Vezir confided the care of his pious bequest - the bridge.","English","9780226020457","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Nobel Prize', 'War', '20th Century', 'Serbian Literature']","['Franz Ferdinand', 'Karađorđe Petrović', 'Sokollu Mehmed Pasha', 'Abidaga', 'Fata Avdagina', 'Radisav', 'Alihodja Mutevelić', 'Osman Effendi Karamanli', 'the man from Plvelje', 'Pop Nikola', 'Mula Ibrahim', 'Arif Beg', 'Shemsibeg Branković', 'Milan Glasinčanin', 'Lotte Apfelmaier', 'Gregor Fedun', 'Janko Stiković', 'Fehim Bhatijarević', 'Nikola Glasičanin', 'Zorka']","Paperback","","314","University of Chicago Press","1977","10/28/45","[]","14654","['7931', '4389', '1743', '444', '147']","96","['Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Bosnia', 'Ottoman Empire']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391505254l/3140.jpg","3176","43",3.82

Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers...Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away...By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, ""The Year of the Flood"" is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive.","English","9780385528771","['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy', 'Canada', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Apocalyptic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']","['Snowman', 'Oryx', 'Crake', 'Toby', 'Ren', 'Zeb']","Hardcover","First United States Edition","431","Doubleday Nan A.

"12321.Beyond_Good_and_Evil","Beyond Good and Evil","","Friedrich Nietzsche, R.J. Hollingdale (Translator), Michael Tanner (Introduction)","4.00","Friedrich Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale with an introduction by Michael Tanner in Penguin Classics.Beyond Good and Evil confirmed Nietzsche's position as the towering European philosopher of his age. The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God, good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy, he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world.This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction, which explains some of the more abstract passages in Beyond Good and Evil.Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable.If you enjoyed Beyond Good and Evil you might like Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, also available in Penguin Classics.""One of the greatest books of a very great thinker."" —Michael Tanner","English","9780140449235","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Religion', 'Psychology', '19th Century', 'Theory', 'Literature', 'History']","['Zarathustra', 'Dionysus (mythology)']","Paperback","","240","Penguin Classics","February 27th 2003","10/28/86","[]","66727","['25093', '23579', '12643', '3569', '1843']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388607391l/12321.jpg","3120","44",3.42

"5344.Hard_Times","Hard Times","","Charles Dickens","3.54","""My satire is against those who see figures and averages, and nothing else,"" proclaimed Charles Dickens in explaining the theme of this classic novel. Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a ""fanatic of the demonstrable fact,"" who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime. Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.Considered Dickens' harshest indictment of mid-19th-century industrial practices and their dehumanizing effects, this novel offers a fascinating tapestry of Victorian life, filled with the richness of detail, brilliant characterization, and passionate social concern that typify the novelist's finest creations.Of Dickens' work, the eminent Victorian critic John Ruskin had this to say: ""He is entirely right in his main drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions.""","English","9780321107213","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Novels', 'Victorian', 'British Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Classic Literature']","['Thomas Gradgrind', ""Mr. M'Choakumchild"", 'Stephen Blackpool', 'Josiah Bounderby', 'Sissy Jupe']","Paperback","","353","Pearson Longman","October 9th 2003","10/28/54","[]","56829","['11022', '19008', '18460', '6062', '2277']","85","['Coketown (United Kingdom)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348651243l/5344.jpg","3103","43",9.19

"43944.Suite_Fran_aise","Suite Française","","Irène Némirovsky, Sandra Smith (Translator)","3.83","The first two stories of a masterwork once thought lost, written by a pre-WWII bestselling author who was deported to Auschwitz and died before her work could be completed.By the early l940s, when Ukrainian-born Irène Némirovsky began working on what would become Suite Française—the first two parts of a planned five-part novel—she was already a highly successful writer living in Paris. But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz: a month later she was dead at the age of thirty-nine. Two years earlier, living in a small village in central France—where she, her husband, and their two small daughters had fled in a vain attempt to elude the Nazis—she'd begun her novel, a luminous portrayal of a human drama in which she herself would become a victim. When she was arrested, she had completed two parts of the epic, the handwritten manuscripts of which were hidden in a suitcase that her daughters would take with them into hiding and eventually into freedom. Sixty-four years later, at long last, we can read Némirovsky's literary masterpiece The first part, ""A Storm in June,"" opens in the chaos of the massive 1940 exodus from Paris on the eve of the Nazi invasion during which several families and individuals are thrown together under circumstances beyond their control. They share nothing but the harsh demands of survival—some trying to maintain lives of privilege, others struggling simply to preserve their lives—but soon, all together, they will be forced to face the awful exigencies of physical and emotional displacement, and the annihilation of the world they know. In the second part, ""Dolce,"" we enter the increasingly complex life of a German-occupied provincial village. Coexisting uneasily with the soldiers billeted among them, the villagers—from aristocrats to shopkeepers to peasants—cope as best they can. Some choose resistance, others collaboration, and as their community is transformed by these acts, the lives of these these men and women reveal nothing less than the very essence of humanity.Suite Française is a singularly piercing evocation—at once subtle and severe, deeply compassionate, and fiercely ironic—of life and death in occupied France, and a brilliant, profoundly moving work of art.","English","9781400096275","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'France', 'World War II', 'War', 'Historical', 'Classics', 'Holocaust', 'Book Club', 'Novels']","['Charlotte Péricand', 'Hubert Péricand', 'Philippe Péricand', 'Gabriel Corte', 'Charles Langelet', 'Maurice Michaud', 'Jeanne Michaud', 'Jean-Marie Michaud', 'Madeleine Sabarie']","Paperback","","431","Vintage","April 10th 2007","09/28/04","['Magnesia Litera for Translation (Litera za překladovou knihu) (2012)', 'Prix Renaudot (2004)', 'PEN Translation Prize for Sandra Smith (2007)', 'French-American Foundation Translation Prize for Fiction (2006)', 'Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize Nominee (2007)']","63320","['18005', '24469', '14699', '4481', '1666']","90","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557142046l/43944._SY475_.jpg","3084","37",2.76

A decade ago, the deadly illness swept through her nation. Most of the infected perished, while many of the children who survived were left with strange markings. Adelina’s black hair turned silver, her lashes went pale, and now she has only a jagged scar where her left eye once was. Her cruel father believes she is a malfetto, an abomination, ruining their family’s good name and standing in the way of their fortune. But some of the fever’s survivors are rumored to possess more than just scars—they are believed to have mysterious and powerful gifts, and though their identities remain secret, they have come to be called the Young Elites.Teren Santoro works for the king. As Leader of the Inquisition Axis, it is his job to seek out the Young Elites, to destroy them before they destroy the nation.

Maternal instinct knows no boundaries, including the nano-neural-net intravenously installed in Dannia Weston's mind to repress her identity, allowing her to perform a mission 300 years before her time. Transported to the year 1954, Dannia becomes a woman with a mid-twentieth century persona, college educated with an aptitude for mechanical invention. Due to her work during the war, she is employed by the U.S. government on a secret project. But what no one knows-including Dannia or those who sent her back to tinker with the mechanical past to reduce future pollution-is what might happen should she become emotionally involved in 1954. The 2254 science team programmed the nano-net to prevent the possibility of pregnancy, but each person reacts to strong emotional stimuli differently, and using birth control not available in 1954 is out of the question. When Dannia falls in love with Peter Hersh and becomes pregnant, her hormones erode a small section of the nano-chained network that stabilizes her new identity, triggering a mild memory rebirth...and threatening her mission and the fate of the world.","","9781478756224","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Epic', 'Drama']","[]","Paperback","","284","Outskirts Press","September 27th 2015","","[]","1524","['719', '705', '53', '35', '12']","97","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444879956l/27111181.jpg","3059","34",18.57

Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery.

"433567.Flatland","Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions","","Edwin A. Abbott, Banesh Hoffmann (Introduction)","3.81","This masterpiece of science (and mathematical) fiction is a delightfully unique and highly entertaining satire that has charmed readers for more than 100 years. The work of English clergyman, educator and Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the journeys of A. Square [sic – ed.], a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions—a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world. Charmingly illustrated by the author, Flatland is not only fascinating reading, it is still a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space.

This intense novel follows a middle-aged man as he contends with a past he has never much thought about - until his closest childhood friends return with a vengeance, one of them from the grave, another maddeningly present. Tony Webster thought he'd left all this behind as he built a life for himself, and by now his marriage and family and career have fallen into an amicable divorce and retirement. But he is then presented with a mysterious legacy that obliges him to reconsider a variety of things he thought he'd understood all along, and to revise his estimation of his own nature and place in the world. A novel so compelling that it begs to be read in a single sitting, with stunning psychological and emotional depth and sophistication, The Sense of an Ending is a brilliant new chapter in Julian Barnes's oeuvre.","English","9780224094153","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'British Literature', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery']","['Anthony ""Tony"" Webster', 'Veronica Mary Ford', 'Adrian Finn', 'Colin Simpson', 'Joe Hunt', 'Phil Dixon', 'Sarah Ford']","Hardcover","1st edition","150","Jonathan Cape","August 4th 2011","","['Booker Prize (2011)', 'Warwick Prize for Writing Nominee for Longlist (2013)', 'Costa Book Award Nominee for Novel (2011)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2011)', 'Europese Literatuurprijs (2012)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2013)', 'Metų verstinė knyga Nominee (2013)']","147473","['33795', '58693', '39311', '12165', '3509']","89","['Bristol, England', 'Chislehurst, England (United Kingdom)', 'London, England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311704453l/10746542.jpg","2933","37",1.79

No other work of fiction so faithfully conveys both the sharp physical realities and the mythic sweep of the transformation of the American frontier—and the transformation of the people who settled it. Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm. But this archetypal success story is darkened by loss, and Alexandra's devotion to the land may come at the cost of love itself.At once a sophisticated pastoral and a prototype for later feminist novels, O Pioneers! is a work in which triumph is inextricably enmeshed with tragedy, a story of people who do not claim a land so much as they submit to it and, in the process, become greater than they were.","English","9780679743620","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'American', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Westerns', '20th Century', 'Classic Literature']","['Alexandra Bergson']","Paperback","","159","Vintage","1992","10/28/13","[]","45610","['13465', '17720', '10575', '2720', '1130']","92","['Nebraska (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388956566l/140963.jpg","2921","45",3.95

"5941033-let-the-great-world-spin","Let the Great World Spin","","Colum McCann (Goodreads Author)","3.94","In the dawning light of a late-summer morning, the people of lower Manhattan stand hushed, staring up in disbelief at the Twin Towers. It is August 1974, and a mysterious tightrope walker is running, dancing, leaping between the towers, suspended a quarter mile above the ground. In the streets below, a slew of ordinary lives become extraordinary in bestselling novelist Colum McCann’s stunningly intricate portrait of a city and its people.Let the Great World Spin is the critically acclaimed author’s most ambitious novel yet: a dazzlingly rich vision of the pain, loveliness, mystery, and promise of New York City in the 1970s.Corrigan, a radical young Irish monk, struggles with his own demons as he lives among the prostitutes in the middle of the burning Bronx. A group of mothers gather in a Park Avenue apartment to mourn their sons who died in Vietnam, only to discover just how much divides them even in grief. A young artist finds herself at the scene of a hit-and-run that sends her own life careening sideways. Tillie, a thirty-eight-year-old grandmother, turns tricks alongside her teenage daughter, determined not only to take care of her family but to prove her own worth.Elegantly weaving together these and other seemingly disparate lives, McCann’s powerful allegory comes alive in the unforgettable voices of the city’s people, unexpectedly drawn together by hope, beauty, and the “artistic crime of the century.” A sweeping and radical social novel, Let the Great World Spin captures the spirit of America in a time of transition, extraordinary promise, and, in hindsight, heartbreaking innocence. Hailed as a “fiercely original talent” (San Francisco Chronicle), award-winning novelist McCann has delivered a triumphantly American masterpiece that awakens in us a sense of what the novel can achieve, confront, and even heal.","English","9781400063734","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'New York', 'Book Club', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Adult Fiction']","['Philippe Petit']","Hardcover","","351","Random House","June 23rd 2009","06/16/09","['National Book Award for Fiction (2009)', 'Ambassador Book Award for Fiction (2010)', 'NAIBA Book of the Year for Fiction (2010)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2009)', 'International Dublin Literary Award (2011)', 'LovelyBooks Leserpreis Nominee for Allgemeine Literatur (2009)']","94405","['31375', '36115', '19111', '5714', '2090']","92","['New York City, New York (United States)', 'Bronx, New York City, New York (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474988022l/5941033.jpg","2905","36",9.73

They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives—and destroyed them.Published anonymously in 1776, six months before the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Paine’s Common Sense was a radical and impassioned call for America to free itself from British rule and set up an independent republican government. Savagely attacking hereditary kingship and aristocratic institutions, Paine urged a new beginning for his adopted country in which personal freedom and social equality would be upheld and economic and cultural progress encouraged.  His pamphlet was the first to speak directly to a mass audience—it went through fifty-six editions within a year of publication—and its assertive and often caustic style both embodied the democratic spirit he advocated, and converted thousands of citizens to the cause of American independence.","English","9780143036258","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Essays', 'Political Science', 'American Revolution']","[]","Paperback","Great Ideas","104","Penguin","September 6th 2005","02/14/76","[]","29902","['10358', '10856', '6909', '1436', '343']","94","['United States of America']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309209451l/161744.jpg","2904","50",5.34

Randolph starts rambling about Norse history and Magnus's birthright: a weapon that has been lost for thousands of years.The more Randolph talks, the more puzzle pieces fall into place. Stories about the gods of Asgard, wolves, and Doomsday bubble up from Magnus's memory. But he doesn't have time to consider it all before a fire giant attacks the city, forcing him to choose between his own safety and the lives of hundreds of innocents. . . .Sometimes, the only way to start a new life is to die.","English","9781423160915","['Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Young Adult', 'Middle Grade', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult Fantasy']","['Annabeth Chase', 'Magnus Chase', 'Hearthstone', 'Blitzen', 'Samirah ""Sam"" Al-Abbas']","Hardcover","First Edition","499","Disney-Hyperion Books","October 6th 2015","","[""Goodreads Choice Award for Middle Grade & Children's (2015)""]","150368","['73421', '49314', '20094', '4657', '2882']","95","['Boston, Massachusetts (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1434701340l/15724396.jpg","2833","36",1.64

Woods (Translator)","4.16","Buddenbrooks, first published in Germany in 1901, when Mann was only twenty-six, has become a classic of modern literature.It is the story of four generations of a wealthy bourgeois family in northern Germany facing the advent of modernity; in an uncertain new world, the family’s bonds and traditions begin to disintegrate. As Mann charts the Buddenbrooks’ decline from prosperity to bankruptcy, from moral and psychic soundness to sickly piety, artistic decadence, and madness, he ushers the reader into a world of stunning vitality, pieced together from births and funerals, weddings and divorces, recipes, gossip, and earthy humor.In its immensity of scope, richness of detail, and fullness of humanity, buddenbrooks surpasses all other modern family chronicles. With remarkable fidelity to the original German text, this superb translation emphasizes the magnificent scale of Mann’s achievement in this riveting, tragic novel.","English","9780679417378","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Germany', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Nobel Prize', 'Literary Fiction']","['Buddenbrooks', 'Antonie Buddenbrook', 'Johann Buddenbrook', 'Elisabeth Buddenbrook', 'Ida Jungmann', 'Thomas Buddenbrook', 'Christian Buddenbrook', 'Jean Jacques Hoffstede', 'Lebrecht Kröger', 'Gotthold Buddenbrook', 'Justus Kröger', 'Klothilde', 'Julie Hagenström', 'Clara Buddenbrook', 'Peter Döhlmann', 'Sesame Weichbrodt', 'Armgard von Schilling', 'Gerda Arnoldsen', 'Bendix Grünlich', 'Morten Schwarzkopf', 'Siegismund Gosch', 'Erika Grünlich', 'Jakob Kröger', 'Jürgen Kröger', 'Sievert Tiburtius', 'Alois Permaneder', 'Hanno Buddenbrook', 'Hugo Weinschenk', 'Edmund Pfühl', 'Hermann Hagenström', 'Kai Mölln']","Hardcover","","731","Everyman's Library","October 4th 1994","10/28/01","[]","21706","['9695', '7434', '3281', '914', '382']","94","['Germany', 'Lübeck (Germany)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1337128414l/80890.jpg","2831","42",10.51

A 1940s #1 Bestseller and a Historic Novel All-Time Favorite A historic novel all-time favorite, after its translation in English from Swedish, The Egyptian topped the bestseller charts in 1949 and the years following. The protagonist of the novel is the fictional character Sinuhe, the royal physician, who tells the story in exile after Akhenaten's fall and death. Apart from incidents in Egypt, the novel charts Sinuhe's travels in then Egyptian-dominated Syria, in Mitanni, Babylon, Minoan Crete, Mitanni, and among the Hittites.The main character of the novel is named after a character in an ancient Egyptian text commonly known as The Story of Sinuhe. The original story dates to a time long before that of Akhenaten: texts are known from as early as the 12th Dynasty.Much concerned about the historical accuracy of his detailed description of ancient Egyptian life forced the author to carry out considerable research into the subject. The result has been praised not only by readers but also by Egyptologists.Waltari had long been interested in Akhenaten and wrote a play about him which was staged in Helsinki in 1938. World War II provided the final impulse for exploring the subject in a novel which, although depicting events that took place over 3,300 years ago ","English","B00OQTE64C","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'Egypt', 'Finnish Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Africa']","['Akhenaten', 'Nefertiti', 'Tutankhamun', 'Kaptah', 'Ay', 'Horemheb', 'Sinuhe', 'Burna-Buriash II', 'Aziru', 'Tiye', 'Beketaten', 'Smenkhkare']","Kindle Edition","","514","","October 20th 2014 ","10/28/44","[]","18604","['8565', '5867', '2841', '895', '436']","93","['Thebes, Egypt (Egypt)', 'Smyrna (Turkey)', 'Jerusalem (Israel)', 'Mitanni', 'Babylon (Iraq)', 'Hattusa (Turkey)', 'Crete (Greece)', 'Mediterranean Sea', 'Amurru', 'Akhetaten (Egypt)', 'Memphis (Egypt)', 'Gaza (Palestinian Territory, Occupied)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441638968l/26216087._SY475_.jpg","2827","31",""

"26004546-lips-of-a-mastodon","Lips of a Mastodon","","Ted Bernal Guevara (Goodreads Author)","3.90","(BACK COVER)Why does Ted Bernal Guevara keep putting out these James Dean conceptual novels? In plain truth, Guevara says, “He’s like a kid (James Dean) I went to class with, rode the bus with and slid down an awesome snow-packed hill with.” And after high school, he goes on to Hollywood fame and immortality while Guevara from his modest bookish world is left to wonder about the iconic image, giving it a stark, poignant voice sixty years later. Guevara grew up in Marion, Indiana, where the actor was born. In 1954, Dean met perhaps the one real romance of his brief life. Italian actress Pier Angeli was barely 22 when her movie The Silver Chalice coincided with Dean’s East of Eden at Warner Brothers. She’d sneak over to watch him perform, and he would do the same. When they finally interact, Pier’s mother disapproves of Dean’s behavior, attire and not being Catholic.Some say it was all for the limelight and publicity. Guevara’s gripping and frank story vies otherwise, excavating the actor’s true passion for the lovely but quaint Ms. Angeli.Guevara is also the author of True Feel, A Circle with Two Corners, and Days of Slint, the first James Dean conceptual novel.","English","9781512216318","['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Psychological Thriller', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adventure']","[]","Paperback","First","226","Rumble Lit Press","September 30th 2015","","[]","482","['179', '184', '48', '34', '37']","85","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438191401l/26004546.jpg","2798","28",6.12

There's only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old June Elbus, and that's her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finn's company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June's world is turned upside down. But Finn's death brings a surprise acquaintance into June's life—someone who will help her to heal, and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart. At Finn's funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a package in the mail.

If you know anything at all about the unlucky Baudelaire children, you already know that even pleasant events lead down the same road to misery.In fact, within the pages you now hold in your hands, the three siblings endure a car accident, a terrible odor, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a large brass reading lamp, and the appearance of a person they'd hoped never to see again.I am bound to record these tragic events, but you are free to put this book back on the shelf and seek something lighter.With all due respect,Lemony Snicket","English","9780439206488","['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Childrens', 'Fantasy', 'Middle Grade', 'Mystery', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Juvenile']","['Count Olaf', 'Klaus Baudelaire', 'Sunny Baudelaire', 'Arthur Poe', 'Violet Baudelaire', 'Dr. Montgomery Montgomery']","Paperback","","192","Scholastic, Inc.","September 30th 1999","","[]","183657","['61697', '69197', '42497', '8087', '2179']","94","['Lousy Lane']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352146294l/78418.jpg","2739","41",1.91

Scott Peck","4.06","The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth316 pp. ""Psychotherapy is all things to all people in this mega-selling pop-psychology watershed, which features a new introduction by the author in this 25th anniversary edition. His agenda in this tome, which was first published in 1978 but didn't become a bestseller until 1983, is to reconcile the psychoanalytic tradition with the conflicting cultural currents roiling the 70s. In the spirit of Me-Decade individualism and libertinism, he celebrates self-actualization as life's highest purpose and flirts with the notions of open marriage and therapeutic sex between patient and analyst. But because he is attuned to the nascent conservative backlash against the therapeutic worldview, Peck also cites Gospel passages, recruits psychotherapy to the cause of traditional religion (he even convinces a patient to sign up for divinity school) and insists that problems must be overcome through suffering, discipline and hard work (with a therapist.) Often departing from the cerebral and rationalistic bent of Freudian discourse for a mystical, Jungian tone more compatible with New Age spirituality, Peck writes of psychotherapy as an exercise in ""love"" and ""spiritual growth,"" asserts that ""our unconscious is God"" and affirms his belief in miracles, reincarnation and telepathy. Peck's synthesis of such clashing elements (he even throws in a little thermodynamics) is held together by a warm and lucid discussion of psychiatric principles and moving accounts of his own patients' struggles and breakthroughs. Harmonizing psychoanalysis and spirituality, Christ and Buddha, Calvinist work ethic and interminable talking cures, this book is a touchstone of our contemporary religio-therapeutic culture."" -- Publishers WeeklyKeywords: MIND & BODY PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY RELIGION","English","9780671250676","['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Personal Development', 'Inspirational', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Relationships']","[]","Paperback","","320","Simon & Schuster","1978","","[]","83787","['34160', '27846', '15910', '4085', '1786']","93","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1322673263l/347852.jpg","2722","42",3.45

When he remarries, a new step-sister enters Molly's quiet life – loveable, but worldly and troubling, Cynthia.

Set in contemporary Moscow, where shape shifters, vampires, and street-sorcerers linger in the shadows, Night Watch is the first book of the hyper-imaginative fantasy pentalogy from best-selling Russian author Sergei Lukyanenko. This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light. The agents of the Dark – the Night Watch – oversee nocturnal activity, while the agents of the Light keep watch over the day. For a thousand years both sides have maintained a precarious balance of power, but an ancient prophecy has decreed that a supreme Other will one day emerge, threatening to tip the scales. Now, that day has arrived. When a mid-level Night Watch agent named Anton stumbles upon a cursed young woman – an uninitiated Other with magnificent potential – both sides prepare for a battle that could lay waste to the entire city, possible the world. With language that throbs like darkly humorous hard-rock lyrics about blood and power, freedom and responsibility, Night Watch is a chilling, cutting-edge thriller, a pulse-pounding ride of fusion fiction that will leave you breathless for the next instalment.","English","9781401359799","['Fantasy', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Vampires', 'Paranormal', 'Russia', 'Supernatural', 'Science Fiction', 'Magic']","['Anton Gorodetsky', 'Svetlana Nazarova', 'Boris Ignatievich Gesar', 'Semyon', 'Tiger Cub', 'Ignat', 'Garik', 'Igor Teplov', 'Yulia', 'Ilya', 'Zabulon', 'Alisa Donnikova', 'Kostya Saushkin', 'Maxim', 'Egor']","Paperback","","455","Miramax Books","July 1st 2006","10/28/98","['Stalker Award for Best Translated Novel (2009)']","39613","['13335', '15540', '7980', '2120', '638']","93","['Moscow (Russian Federation)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351342315l/359375.jpg","2659","34",3.8

As Arthur soon discovers, the dark shadow of the prison stretches far beyond its walls to affect the lives of many, from the kindly Mr Panks, the reluctant rent-collector of Bleeding Heart Yard, and the tipsily garrulous Flora Finching, to Merdle, an unscrupulous financier, and the bureaucratic Barnacles in the Circumlocution Office.

Martin","4.56","For the first time, all five novels in the epic fantasy series that inspired HBO's ""Game of Thrones ""are together in one boxed set. An immersive entertainment experience unlike any other, A Song of Ice and Fire has earned George R. R. Martin--dubbed ""the American Tolkien"" by ""Time"" magazine--international acclaim and millions of loyal readers. Now here is the entire monumental cycle: A GAME OF THRONESA CLASH OF KINGSA STORM OF SWORDSA FEAST OF CROWSA DANCE WITH DRAGONS Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.  Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.""","English","9781780484259","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Dragons', 'Science Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Adult']","['Tyrion Lannister', 'Arya Stark', 'Khal Drogo', 'Aerys Targaryen II', 'Aegon Targaryen', 'Jon Snow', 'Jaime Lannister', 'Cersei Lannister', 'Petyr Baelish', 'Sansa Stark', 'Varys', 'Brienne of Tarth', 'Samwell Tarly', 'Arianne Martell', 'Victarion Greyjoy', 'Asha Greyjoy', 'Pyp', 'Tommen Baratheon', 'Brandon Stark', 'Catelyn Stark', 'Daenerys Targaryen', 'Robb Stark', 'Joffrey Baratheon', 'Tywin Lannister', 'Stannis Baratheon', 'Melisandre', 'Davos Seaworth', 'Lysa Arryn', 'Hodor', 'Sandor Clegane', 'Jorah Mormont', 'Grenn', 'Oswell Kettleback', 'Theon Greyjoy', 'Euron Greyjoy', 'Margaery Tyrell', 'Robert Baratheon', 'Ser Gregor Clegane', 'Qyburn', 'Lord Bronn', 'Walder Frey', 'Eddard Stark', 'Yara Greyjoy', 'Jory Cassel', 'Viserys Targaryen', 'Olenna Tyrell']","Mass Market Paperback","Re-Packaged Edition","5216","Zatpix","July 22nd 2011","10/28/00","[]","53233","['36854', '11677', '3118', '890', '694']","97","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339340118l/12177850.jpg","2616","35",""

Including warts and all. The first was the Indochinese People fighting against the French colonists and their suppliers and allies from the USA. The second was the people of Indochina (Cambodia, Laos & Vietnam) fighting against an allied coalition force made up of Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, South Vietnam and the USA. The Second Indochina War is usually referred to as the Vietnam War. This book examines the re-adjustment of Vietnamese society after the uprising of the Tay Son Brothers in 1770, their stopping of the Trin and Nguyen families oppression of the Vietnamese people. The coming of the Catholic Church and how this affected the people is examined. As well the activities of Pineau de Bahrain, who was a missionary and the Bishop of Adran - he did much to ensure the French takeover of the majority of South East Asia. That was followed by the French takeover and full colonisation and rule by France. To better control the people, the French forbade the use of Chinese characters in writing and transcribed the entire Vietnamese language into the Latin alphabet, which was then taught in all schools. During WW2, Asian people saw that the Caucasian people could be beaten, That resulted in the First Indochina War, which ended with the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu. The Second Indochina War ended in 1975 with the withdrawal of the last American soldier from Vietnam. The Third Indochina War ended when the Vietnamese Army invaded Kampuchea, resulting in Vietnamese tanks entering its capital while the Pol Pot administration fled into the jungle.","","9999999999999","['Drama', 'Book Club', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Epic', 'Fiction']","[]","Kindle Edition","","503","","July 10th 2019","","[]","6162","['2808', '2744', '333', '217', '60']","96","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563012029l/49599733._SX318_SY475_.jpg","2608","28",""

"1249630.Os_Maias","Os Maias","","Eça de Queirós, Ester de Lemos (Introdução)","4.02","Biblioteca Ulisseia de Autores Portugueses #15Os Maias é uma das obras mais conhecidas do escritor português Eça de Queiroz. O livro foi publicado no Porto em 1888. A acção de Os Maias passa-se em Lisboa, na segunda metade do século XIX, e apresenta-nos a história de três gerações da família Maia. A acção inicia-se no Outono de 1875, quando Afonso da Maia, nobre e pobre proprietário, se instala no Ramalhete com o neto recém formado em Medicina. Neste momento faz-se uma longa descrição da casa - ""O Ramalhete,"" cujo nome tem origem num painel de azulejos com um ramo de girassóis, e não em algo fresco ou campestre, tal como o nome nos remete a pensar. Afonso da Maia era o personagem mais simpático do romance e aquele que o autor mais valorizou, pois não se lhe conhecem defeitos. É um homem de carácter, culto e requintado nos gostos. Em jovem aderiu aos ideais do Liberalismo e foi obrigado, por seu pai, a sair de casa e a instalar-se em Inglaterra. Após o pai falecer regressa a Lisboa para casar com Maria Eduarda Runa, mas pouco tempo depois escolhe o exílio por razões de ordem política. Há em Os Maias um retrato da Lisboa da epóca. Carlos, que mora na Rua das Janelas Verdes, caminha com frequência até ao Rossio (embora, por vezes, vá a cavalo ou de carruagem). Algumas das lojas citadas no livro ainda existem - a Casa Havaneza, no Chiado, por exemplo. É possível seguir os diferentes percursos de Carlos ou do Ega pelas suas da Baixa lisboeta, ainda que algumas tenham mudado de nome. No final do livro, quando Carlos volta a Lisboa muitos anos depois, somos levados a ver as novidades - a Avenida da Liberdade, que substituiu o Passeio Público, e que é descrita como uma coisa nova, e feia pela sua novidade, exactamente como nos anos 70 se falava das casas de emigrante. O romance veicula sobre o país uma perspectiva muito derrotista, muito pessimista. Tirando a natureza (o Tejo, Sintra, Santa Olávia...), é tudo uma choldra ignóbil. Predomina uma visão de estrangeirado, de quem só valoriza as civilizações superiores - da França e Inglaterra, principalmente. Os políticos são mesquinhos, ignorantes ou corruptos (Gouvarinho, Sousa Neto...); os homens das Letras sao boémios e dissolutos, retrógrados ou distantes da realidade concreta (Alencar, Ega...: lembre-se o que se passou no Sarau do Teatro da Trindade); os jornalistas boémios e venais (Palma...); os homens do desporto não conseguem organizar uma corrida de cavalos, pois não há hipódromo à altura, nem cavalos, nem cavaleiros, as pessoas não vestem como o evento exigia, as senhoras traziam vestidos de missa. Para cúmulo de tudo isto, os protagonistas acabam vencidos da vida. Apesar de ser isto referido no fim do livro, pode-se ver que ainda há alguma esperanca implícita, nas passagens em que Carlos da Maia e João da Ega dizem que o apetite humano é a causa de todos os seus problemas e que portanto nunca mais terão apetites, mas logo a seguir dizem que lhes está a apetecer um ""prato de paio com ervilhas,"" ou quando dizem que a pressa não leva a nada e que a vida deve ser levada com calma mas começam a correr para apanhar o americano (eléctrico). Mais do que crítica de costumes, o romance mostra-nos um país - sobretudo Lisboa - que se dissolve, incapaz de se regenerar. Quando o autor escreve mais tarde A Cidade e as Serras, expõe uma atitude muito mais construtiva: o protagonista regenera-se pela descoberta das raízes rurais ancestrais não atingidas pela degradação da civilização, num movimento inverso ao que predomina n'Os Maias.","Portuguese","9789725681367","['Classics', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Portugal', 'School', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels']","['Carlos da Maia', 'João da Ega', 'Maria Eduarda', 'Afonso da Maia', 'Maria Monforte', 'Eusébiozinho', 'Alencar', 'Conde de Gouvarinho', 'Sousa Neto', 'Palma Cavalão', 'Dâmaso Salcede', 'Steinbroken', 'Cohen', 'Craft', 'Condessa de Gouvarinho', 'Cruges', 'Tancredo', 'Sr. Guimarães', 'Rufino']","Paperback","","681","Verbo","April 2003","10/28/88","['PEN Translation Prize for Margaret Jull Costa (2008)', 'Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize (2008)']","17143","['6235', '6476', '3205', '925', '302']","93","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362526641l/1249630.jpg","2584","30",1.64

"27037.Confessions","Confessions","","Augustine of Hippo, Henry Chadwick (Translator/Introduction), Albert Cook Outler (Translator)","3.92","Augustine's Confessions is one of the most influential and most innovative works of Latin literature. Written in the author's early forties in the last years of the fourth century A.D. and during his first years as a bishop, they reflect on his life and on the activity of remembering and interpreting a life. Books I-IV are concerned with infancy and learning to talk, schooldays, sexual desire and adolescent rebellion, intense friendships and intellectual exploration. Augustine evolves and analyses his past with all the resources of the reading which shaped his mind: Virgil and Cicero, Neoplatonism and the Bible. This volume, which aims to be usable by students who are new to Augustine, alerts readers to the verbal echoes and allusions of Augustine's brilliant and varied Latin, and explains his theological and philosophical questioning of what God is and what it is to be human.

It was published in the autumn of 1973 and has been translated into 46 languages. Many of its themes are unusually dark and heavy for the children's book genre. Disease, death, tyranny, betrayal and rebellion are some of the dark themes that permeate the story. The lighter themes of the book involve platonic love, loyalty, hope, courage and pacifism.The two main characters are two brothers; the older Jonatan and the younger Karl. The two brothers' surname was originally Lion, but they are generally known as Lionheart. Karl's nickname is Skorpan (Rusky) since Jonatan likes these typical Swedish toasts or crusts.In Nangijala, a land in ""the campfires and storytelling days"", the brothers experience adventures. Together with a resistance group they lead the struggle against the evil Tengil, who rules with the aid of the fearsome fire-breathing dragon, Katla.","English","9781930900240","['Fantasy', 'Childrens', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Swedish Literature', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Adventure', 'Young Adult', 'Middle Grade', 'Sweden']","['Sofia', 'Karl Lionheart', 'Jonatan Lionheart']","Hardcover","","231","Purple House Press","December 31st 2004","10/28/73","['Zilveren Griffel (1975)', 'Wilhelm-Hauff-Preis (1979)', 'Międzynarodowa Nagroda Literacka im.

A few days later, they are picked up by a British ship. However, the Patna and its passengers are later also saved, and the reprehensible actions of the crew are exposed. The other participants evade the judicial court of inquiry, leaving Jim to the court alone.

The novel is counted as one of 100 best books of the 20th century.Joseph Conrad (1857-1924), was a Polish author who wrote in English after settling in England. Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English, though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties. He wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent world. He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English tragic sensibility into English literature.Contents: Lord JimMemoirs & Letters:A Personal Record; or Some ReminiscencesThe Mirror of the SeaNotes on Life & LettersBiography & Critical Essays:Joseph Conrad (A Biography) by Hugh WalpoleJoseph Conrad by John Albert MacyA Conrad Miscellany by John Albert MacyJoseph Conrad by Virginia Woolf","English","9781551111728","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Classic Literature', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']","['Charles Marlow', 'Jim']","Paperback","","455","Broadview Press Inc","November 7th 2000","10/28/00","[]","27174","['6495', '9085', '7640', '2729', '1225']","85","['Malaysia']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372366969l/12194.jpg","2507","42",3.97

But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known.No other powerful empire ever bequeathed such mountains of evidence about its birth and destruction as the Third Reich. When the bitter war was over, and before the Nazis could destroy their files, the Allied demand for unconditional surrender produced an almost hour-by-hour record of the nightmare empire built by Adolph Hitler. This record included the testimony of Nazi leaders and of concentration camp inmates, the diaries of officials, transcripts of secret conferences, army orders, private letters—all the vast paperwork behind Hitler's drive to conquer the world.The famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer, who had watched and reported on the Nazis since 1925, spent five and a half years sifting through this massive documentation. The result is a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind.This worldwide bestseller has been acclaimed as the definitive book on Nazi Germany; it is a classic work.The accounts of how the United States got involved and how Hitler used Mussolini and Japan are astonishing, and the coverage of the war-from Germany's early successes to her eventual defeat-is must reading","English","9780671728687","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Politics', 'Germany', 'Historical', 'Military Fiction', 'Holocaust', 'Military History']","[]","Mass Market Paperback","50th Anniversary Edition","1614","Simon & Schuster","November 15th 1990","10/17/60","['National Book Award for Nonfiction (1961)', 'Cornelius Ryan Award (1960)']","101287","['46771', '33009', '15685', '3527', '2295']","94","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331223772l/767171.jpg","2505","39",3.74

When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a Tätowierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.Imprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion.

"53447.El_t_nel","El túnel","","Ernesto Sabato, Nino Pipia (Translator)","4.05","Breve e intensa novela publicada en 1948, este logrado fruto de la denominada ""literatura existencial"" le dio a su autor un reconocimiento que traspasó las fronteras nacionales. Para quien todavía no la leyó, El túnel es la mejor introducción al universo prodigioso de Ernesto Sábato; para quien la conoce, un clásico de las letras del continente, una historia sobre el drama del hombre arrojado en el sinsentido más doloroso: la conciencia de la nada. El narrador describe una historia de amor y muerte en la que muestra la soledad del individuo contemporáneo. No están ausentes de esta trama policial y de suspenso, la locura y la increíble reflexión del protagonista, el pintor Juan Pablo Castel, debatiéndose por comprender las causas que lo arrastraron a matar a la mujer que amaba, María Iribarne, y que era su única vía de salvación. En este alucinante drama de la vida interior, seres intrincados en la bestial búsqueda de comprensión ceden a la mentira, la hipocresía y los celos desmedidos hasta el crimen más inexplicable. Aventura amorosa, aventura onírica, aventura del ser que dan testimonio de un asesinato, de cierta memoria culpable y de una valiente introspección. Técnicamente perfecta y de lectura apasionante, El túnel excede el negativismo ácido de Sartre y la frenética huida hacia el vacío que plantea El extranjero de Camus, pero tiene de esos dos maestros literarios la impronta genial que hace de la escritura una radiografía del alma atormentada.","Spanish","9789871144266","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Spanish Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Latin American', 'Latin American Literature', 'School', '20th Century', 'Thriller']","['Juan Pablo Castel', 'Maria Iribarne']","Paperback","","158","Booket","January 28th 2003","10/28/48","[]","45633","['16955', '17221', '8662', '2161', '634']","94","['Buenos Aires (Argentina)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170423850l/53447._SY475_.jpg","2469","28",11.91
